It&#8217;s tough to compile these lists considering the excellent year we&#8217;ve had for music. Although we are here to celebrate the following ten artists and their excellent 2010 releases, they weren&#8217;t the only ones. So to all artists to remain true to the cliché-free hip-hop that we love here at Lesson Six, thanks for an awesome year. Anyway, let&#8217;s get down to the nitty gritty.

The re-birth that Eligh took after overcoming an addiction to drugs was finally complete when he released his first solo album in five years. The highly autobiographical, Grey Crow takes you on a deeply personal journey filled with mistakes and wrongdoings. It&#8217;s not entirely perfect, it even borders on a few clichés thanks to a few needless guest-spots, but it makes a great first impression and it&#8217;s an impression that prevails. They say you have to go through something tough before you can write good music, while we don&#8217;t agree with that, it&#8217;s tough to argue that it does help after listening to Grey Crow. **SM**

## <img class="alignleft" title="Persona" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/themes/lessonsix/script/timthumb.php?src=http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Elaquent-Persona.jpg&w=240&zc=1" alt="" width="240" height="240" />9. Elaquent&#8217;s Persona

<div>
  <p>
    “Upbeat. Smooth. Laidback. Eclectic. Off Kilter. 8 Bit. Swinging,” but more than anything, it’s fun; you get the feeling that<em> Elaquent</em> enjoyed recording this. It’s more of an EP than a full release, but <em>Elaquent</em> has produced an album that showcases his talents and passions as a producer. Amongst the Asian Samurai samples of “Shogun’s Orders” and the love ballad to SEGA in “Mastered System” is an album that flows from start to finish, a wonderful little stop-gap between his full releases. <strong>SW</strong>

Soulcrate Music&#8217;s The Heartland Panic

I&#8217;m pretty sure this is the only album on the list to not have gotten a full review from any of us at Lesson Six Towers. So, this is one of the last times I&#8217;ll be able to sell you on Soulcrate Music&#8217;s The Heartland Panic. The whole album just oozes confidence with its massive spectrum of musical styles and catchy hooks. To be honest, you can&#8217;t ask for much more than sharp lyricism and tightly tuned production and Soulcrate Music have delivered it by the truck load. Great, feel-good music. **SM**

## <img class="alignleft" title="Sneakerboxxx" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/themes/lessonsix/script/timthumb.php?src=http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jeffspec_sneakerboxx.jpg&w=240&zc=1" alt="" width="240" height="215" />7. Jeff Spec&#8217;s Sneakerboxxx

_Jeff Spec_ is one busy man. I’ve lost count of the amount of videos, collaborations and reviews I’ve put up in the past few months. Thankfully everything has been great, including _Sneakerboxx_, his latest release. It has the opening track of the year for me in “Turn it UP!”. It continues from there with a collection of anthemic choruses, great beats, clever lyrics and a some complementary guests. _Sneakerboxx_ is the perfect accompaniment to this bleak weather we’ve been getting, it’ll warm your mind and get you ready for the brighter times ahead. **SW**

## <img class="alignleft" title="Daily Methods" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/themes/lessonsix/script/timthumb.php?src=http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/33paphl.jpg&w=240&zc=1" alt="" width="240" height="213" />6. Incise&#8217;s Daily Methods

I normally hesitate when going into a producer&#8217;s solo album as they tend to sound like label samplers rather than standalone albums. So that&#8217;s why it was surprising that Daily Methods stayed solid (and more importantly, cliché free) throughout despite featuring sixteen different vocalists. Shad, Ajaxx, Okay City and a plethora underground artists were carefully handpicked and were allowed to experiment over Incise&#8217;s chilled out jazz infused beats. With the amount of people involved, you would expect someone to drop the ball along the way, fortunately, Daily Methods takes that ball and runs with it. **SM**

## <img class="alignleft" title="Vaudeville" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/themes/lessonsix/script/timthumb.php?src=http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/4625612656_0818f0aea1_b.jpg&w=240&zc=1" alt="" width="240" height="240" />5. D-Sisive&#8217;s Vaudeville

Derek from Northcliffe is another one of those artists that I knew of but ashamedly never looked into until I bought _Vaudeville_, and what can I say, I’m in love. I’ve passed on the love to numerous friends and family and now the man practically has a Scottish fan club. On first listen I wasn’t sure that _Vaudeville_ was entirely Lesson 6 material but even when _D-sisive_ is at his angriest or darkest he manages to make it humorous. The album is full of standout tracks that talk about his own ups-and-downs, stories, and the future. Go get it and keep an eye on the site for more as _D-sisive_ has been a prolific chap. **SW**

_Standout Tracks: Just An Ostrich, Ray Charles Looking For a Star & I Love a Girl_

## <img class="alignleft" title="City of Dirt" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/themes/lessonsix/script/timthumb.php?src=http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Bully-Blinders-cover.jpg&w=240&zc=1" alt="" width="240" height="240" />4. Bully Blinders&#8217; City of Dirt

Sam had the pleasure of reviewing this and it almost sneaked past my radar. Thanks to Lesson Six, it didn’t. Big bold beats and humorous lyrics are the first thing that hits you. Sam summed it up perfectly when he said “packed with more depth than you’ll first think.” Upon first listen I was appreciating the fun tracks and the production but tracks like “Aim Low Kid” and “Rather Be” really hit home and are packed with some really valid points that took me aback. “Continental Breakfast” keep things light and shows _Bully Blinders_ lyrical strength with lots of fruit loopy cereal references. A great listen throughout. **SW**

_Standout Tracks: TruckStop Food, Aim Low Kid & Can’t Imagine_

## <img class="alignleft" title="A Miraculous Kind of Machine" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/themes/lessonsix/script/timthumb.php?src=http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-11-at-15.49.29.png&w=240&zc=1" alt="" width="240" height="240" />3. Junk Science&#8217;s A Miraclous Kind of Machine

The self-described description as &#8216;their weird version of rap music&#8217; couldn&#8217;t be more spot on. Put simply, Junk Science isn&#8217;t for everyone. However, those with an open mind and enough money (to inevitably buy their first two albums) will find a new favourite. While AMKOM isn&#8217;t decisively their best effort, it contains some of Snafu&#8217;s best production and some of Baje One&#8217;s wittiest lines. Also these guys are now running their own label, that needs to be applauded with the current financial situation. **SM**

_Standout Tracks: Really Man, Fire Drill & No Matter Rap_

## <img class="alignleft" title="In The Dying of The Light" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/themes/lessonsix/script/timthumb.php?src=http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/KWES.jpg&w=240&zc=1" alt="" width="240" height="240" />2. Kwes&#8217; In The Dying of the Light

My personal album of the year was dropped into Lesson 6’s inbox and it has been played pretty much constantly since that afternoon. At only seven tracks long it’s more of an EP than an album, but the catchy choruses and the clever verses mean you’ll be singing along and uncovering new lines many a listen later. _KWES_ swings from political to positive on the instrumentally eclectic beats from producer _James Hancock_. It’s one of those rare times where you get an emcee and a producer who both complement each other so well. Whether together or alone, this EP has cemented my interest in these artists. You have no excuse, take a half hour of your day and go download this [free album](http://kwes.bandcamp.com/album/against-the-dying-of-the-ligh). **SW**

## <img class="alignleft" title="TSOL" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/themes/lessonsix/script/timthumb.php?src=http://lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/TSOL.jpg&w=240&zc=1" alt="" width="240" height="240" />1. Shad&#8217;s TSOL

While over in America during the summer I was lucky enough to take a week road-trip from San Francisco to Las Vegas (and everything in between). Before hand we dropped by Ameoba Records to fill in a few blanks in the library. I&#8217;d managed to dig out a reduced copy of Shad&#8217;s TSOL. Along with a limited handful of others, TSOL was one of the CDs to be constantly repeated over the course of our 2000 round mile trip. I can&#8217;t listen to Cut Chemist&#8217;s excellent solo album, I can&#8217;t stand that EMI Compilation and I haven&#8217;t touched Thes One&#8217;s Lifestyle Marketing since. Shad&#8217;s TSOL remains the only album that retains it&#8217;s quality and remains highly replayable despite being constantly cycled round. For that reason, TSOL is head and shoulders above the rest as our album of the year. **SM**
