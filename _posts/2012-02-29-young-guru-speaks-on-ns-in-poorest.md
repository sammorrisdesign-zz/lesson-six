We&#8217;re not normally ones to hype up your latest rap &#8220;beef&#8221; that&#8217;s clogging up mainstream rap sites, but this isn&#8217;t one of _those_ videos. This is a refreshingly open & frank response to Yasiin Bei&#8217;s (or Mos Def as you know him) flip on &#8220;N\****s In Paris&#8221;, that we posted [last week](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/ns-in-poorest-by-yasiin-bey/).Â Young Guru, frequent producer and engineer of Jay-Z, recorded this vlog to clarify his thoughts on what Def&#8217;s real intentions were, before going onto grander issues. It&#8217;s quite honestly the kind of humility that we need more of in rap.
