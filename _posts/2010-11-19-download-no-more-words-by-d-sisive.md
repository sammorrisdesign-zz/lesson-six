Derek from Northcliffe has dropped two new free tracks for your listening pleasure. Well I say two, but there&#8217;s actually five tracks when you include the radio version and the instrumentals. &#8220;No More Words&#8221; is an ambitious sound with a haunting, chanting chorus while &#8220;If&#8230;&#8221; is a fun and honest track where D-sisive takes pops at modern hip-hop and bigs up his own music at the same time. If you follow Derek on Twitter then you&#8217;ll know that there is a video incoming, but this one should do for now.
