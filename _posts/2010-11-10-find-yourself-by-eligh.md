I&#8217;m being pleasantly surprised with every track on Eligh&#8217;s recently released album, Grey Crow. Expect a generally positive review soon.

In the meantime, I&#8217;ll do what I normally do when I&#8217;m reviewing an album and that&#8217;s share the best track at the moment. &#8220;Find Yourself&#8221; is a very self-reflecting four and a half minutes with some smart sampling in the background. Anyway, stop reading this and listen to it. Then you can [listen to Eligh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goS2N0i7Xew) talking about it.
