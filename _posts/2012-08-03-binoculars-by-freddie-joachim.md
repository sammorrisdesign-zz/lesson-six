This is a really really dope flip by producer Freddie Joachim. I have really come to appreciate his work over the past couple months and this song really showcases his talents. You can download this track <a href="http://soundcloud.com/freddiejoachim/freddie-joachim-binoculars" target="_blank">here</a>
