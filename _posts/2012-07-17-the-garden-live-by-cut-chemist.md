We&#8217;re still waiting for new Cut Chemist cuts like [Outro](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/05/outro-by-cut-chemist/), but in the meantime he&#8217;s just released a 2009 live performance of &#8220;The Garden&#8221;. The Audience&#8217;s Listening&#8217;s longest track gets its due with a stunning live rendition played with help by the Seattle Symphony.

_Update: Looks like the original video has been pulled. We managed to dig up a short two minute video of the same performance though._
