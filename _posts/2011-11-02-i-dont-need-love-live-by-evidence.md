While swearing at the camera might go out of date, Evidence&#8217;s rhymes still feel as fresh as they did when he was with DJ Babu & Rakaa as Dilated Peoples. Here&#8217;s Evidence performing live &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Need Love&#8221;, one of the handful of self-produced tracks from Cats & Dogs, on Knocksteady TV.
