I&#8217;ve admired TiRon & Ayomari&#8217;s work since hearing some of their solo material a few years back, and gained even more respect after their standout effort, A Sucker For Pumps from last year. This album is presented by through their label, and features a few different artists besides TiRon & Ayomari, most familiar Oddisee and James Fauntleroy, both on the production side and as vocalists. This is a really great album just listening to it a couple times, and features some stand out tracks such as the closer and my personal favorite HNGRY, and They Go, which is one we heard before and produced by Oddisee.
