Following up on In Case I Don&#8217;t Make it, Has-Lo through Mello Music Group released Conversation B earlier this week. This album consists of an array of great producers such as Apollo Brown, Kev Brown, Oddisee, and Exile to name a few. This is a really solid effort and the production on each track is great.
