Despite recently releasing their great sophomore album _[Moon Under Eyelids](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/05/review-bully-blinders-moon-under-eyelids/)_, Alternative Hip-Hop duo Bully Blinders are straight on with new material to celebrate their recent San Diego Music AwardsÂ [Best Rap Album](http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/blog-947-san-diego-music-awar.html) nomination. It&#8217;s nice to see artists switch it up occasionally and &#8220;Bernie Lomax&#8221; is a massive return to the kind of enjoyable banter found on _City of Dirt_.
