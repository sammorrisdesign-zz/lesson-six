J-Live has been stepping up the content in the build up to his fifth full release, SPTA. Apparently random letters as [your](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/07/shad-tsol/) album name is a thing now. Anyway, here&#8217;s some free music! While it&#8217;s downloading you should check out [his release](http://j-live.bandcamp.com/album/j-live-the-way-that-i-rhyme-poetry-in-motion-single) from earlier in the year.
