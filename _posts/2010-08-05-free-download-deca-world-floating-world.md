Who loves free music? I love free music. I bet you all love free music too, right? Well imagine how wide my grin was when I found this little album nesting on bandcamp, all shiny and thrifty.

I haven&#8217;t had the time to digest it fully as it was only released yesterday and I only found it today; but it does sound really good. An almost casual mix of hip hop beats and experimental electronic sounds are infused to create something with a really chilled sound.

Go download it from _Deca One&#8217;s_ [Bandcamp page](http://decaone.bandcamp.com/) before this high school-er from Minnesota becomes famous and ends up charging us.
