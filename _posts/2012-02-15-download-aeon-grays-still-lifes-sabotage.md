Aeon Gray is a conscious lyricist we&#8217;ve unfortunately slept on for too long. So to make up for that, we implore you to go and give this man money for this EP. It might be a little short in five tracks and one instrumental, but we&#8217;re advocates of quality first, so get that wallet out. Although for those so inclined it is available on a name your price deal, and the minimum is 0. If you&#8217;re into that.
