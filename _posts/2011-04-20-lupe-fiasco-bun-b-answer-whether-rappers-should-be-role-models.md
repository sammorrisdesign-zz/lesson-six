Here&#8217;s an interesting video that was posted on Word is Bond earlier in the week. Here Lupe Fiasco and Bun B answer the question &#8211; should rappers be role models? Running a clich√©-free hip-hop site means having this conversation with people alot and we&#8217;re always up for people opening up the debate. Although, on this specific video, I&#8217;ve got to disagree with the last point that Lupe makes. Schools are primarily told what they have to teach by governments while rappers have much more freedom. So by saying &#8220;Miseducation isn&#8217;t any different just because we make it rhyme&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really make too much sense, because nobody is telling you to miseducate people.
