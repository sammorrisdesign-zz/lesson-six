You have no idea how hard it is to find out the details of a group when their Myspace and bandcamp pages aren&#8217;t in English. Anyway, from what I can tell this is a collaboration of three artists &#8211; Bocafloja from Mexco, Hache St from the Dominican Republic and Cambio from California &#8211; and this is the first single of the new album, Quilombo Radio Vol.2.

I like it. Now to go and find volume 1 and brush up on my Spanish.
