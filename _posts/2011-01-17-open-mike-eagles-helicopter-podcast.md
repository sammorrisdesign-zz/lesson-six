Time for something a little different by Open Mike Eagle. It&#8217;s basically just him talking about hip-hop to himself with the promise of guests appearing later on. It&#8217;s a little strange but we wouldn&#8217;t expect anything else from OME.

Give it a listen on [his site](http://mikeeagle.net/2011/01/new-podcast-helicopter-episode-one/).

Update: I should probably let people know that not all the musical content played on the podcast fits under our mantra. However, if you&#8217;re into Open Mike Eagle (and why aren&#8217;t you?) you shouldn&#8217;t let that stop you.
