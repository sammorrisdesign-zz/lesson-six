As with all Esoteric releases I&#8217;m stuck on the fence. Yeah, the new album 1212 is full of brag and battle rap but it has a few saving graces. Namely the album closer, yeah it&#8217;s borderline brag and battle but with a subject, so it&#8217;s not as generic. Let me know what you think, then I&#8217;ll let you know what I think later in the week.
