Do not adjust your internet. I ended up spending a lot of the summer listening to Open Mike Eagle&#8217;s latest, as I end up doing every year. [_4NML HSPTL_](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/07/review-open-mike-eagles-4nml-hspl/) was easily his most concise and overall better album so far. The visuals for &#8220;Self Medication Chant&#8221; are too appropriate, as director Brood Baby Jed has fun with digitalÂ distortion.
