This week the UK&#8217;s Matt Ford, aka DJ Format, will release his first album in nearly seven years. _Statement of Intent_, the long awaited follow up to 2005&#8242;s _If You Can&#8217;t Join &#8216;em, Beat &#8216;em_ is set to feature DJ Format&#8217;s incredibly strong boom-bap production while also giving great independent rappers a great platform to be heard. For those unfortunate enough to have missed the first two albums in the mid-naughties, here are DJ Format&#8217;s Essentials.

## The Hit Song (feat. Abdominal)

_From the album Music For The Mature B-Boy_



The one thing DJ Format had a knack for doing was finding great emcees, here we were introduced to Canadian rapper and frequent Format collaborator, Abdominal. His strong delivery and conceptual lyrics definitely made DJ Format&#8217;s already great production a head above the rest.

## The Turning Point

_From the album If You Can&#8217;t Join &#8216;em, Beat &#8216;em_



Matt&#8217;s albums didn&#8217;t just give a platform for up and coming emcees though as between raucous cuts, he&#8217;d occasionally let loose on the turntable and throw up these amazing instrumentals. Tracks like The Turning Point are still regularly heard in caf√©s &#038; documentaries to this to day.

## Vicious Battle Raps (feat. Abdominal)

_From the album Music For The Mature B-Boy_



Another great video, another great DJ Format track featuring Abdominal. Here Abs shows off his impressive breath control in delivering some of the best battle rap lines you&#8217;re likely to hear.

## We Know Something You Don&#8217;t Know (feat. Chali 2na & Akil)

_From the album Music For The Mature B-Boy_



Jurassic 5&#8242;s Chali 2na & Akil teamed up with the UK DJ at the peak of J5&#8242;s run, coming just a year after Power in Numbers dropped. Considering Cut Chemist&#8217;s lack of involvement in the consequent Jurassic 5 release, this is arguably the last great Jurassic 5 track before they split for good.

## 3 Feet Deep (feat. Abdominal & D-Sisive)

_From the album If You Can&#8217;t Join &#8216;em, Beat &#8216;em_



It&#8217;s crazy to think that this up and coming rapper would go onto to change his image from plucky lyrical prankster to the angst filled expressive rapper we know today. Here him and Abdominal (who else?) ferociously trade lines over hard-hitting drums.

## Dope Pusher (feat. Sureshot La Rock)

_From the album Statement of Intent_



Finally, a track we heard about a year ago, a taste of the album featuring Sureshot La Rock.
