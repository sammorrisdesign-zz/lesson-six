We continue our countdown of the top 50 tracks of 2011 with those just outside the top 30.

## 40. &#8220;Music Plays On&#8221; by Thomas Prime

Thomas Prime is one of the many up and coming producers who has been heavily influenced by Nujabes. This track was found on his album Waiting for Tomorrow. The jazzy soulful production is a great bedrock for the guest appearances by the 49ers who fit perfectly on this track.



## 39. &#8220;Slumdog&#8221; by Moruf

In one of the pleasing trends of 2011, we saw a handful of minimal and atmospheric jazz-based beats. This one produced by J Dilla, excellently used by Moruf.



## 38. &#8220;808s & Quintets&#8221; by Trebles & Blues

Occasionally instrumentals come along that just sound epic, Trebles & Blues delivered enough of them on his free EP, that at least one deserved a mention here. What&#8217;s surprising is that somebody hasn&#8217;t tried to rap over this yet.



## 37. &#8220;Make Some Noise&#8221; by The Beastie Boys

I&#8217;ll admit the video for this probably made more of an impact than the track, but beat alone was enough to know that the Beasties have returned to form.



## 36. &#8220;Native Sun&#8221; by Blitz the Ambassador

This year everything Shad touched turned to gold. Which was fortunate for others, as he was on so many guest spots throughout 2011. Here he joins Blitz the Ambassador on &#8220;Native Sun&#8221;, a highlight from the album of the same name.

## 35. &#8220;Introdiction&#8221; by Scroobius Pip

Scroobius Pip finally went solo this year with his album Distraction Pieces. While I have to concede that it wasn&#8217;t his most well-rounded album, it definitely made a powerful introduction.



## 34. &#8220;California&#8221; by Serengeti

Written before Serengeti moved to California, this humorous poke at The Golden State, was one of many highlights off Family & Friends.



## 33. &#8220;Build Jewelz&#8221; by Has-Lo

Has-Lo burst onto the scene this year with his debut album In Case I Don&#8217;t Make It. This is a very laid back track, with some solid production. This track along with the remix released on Conversation B is great.



## 32. &#8220;Flawless&#8221; by Shad

Last year&#8217;s album of the year winner, Shad, followed up T.S.O.L with a stunningly consistant barrage of guest appearances & one off tracks. However, it was the Frank Dukes produced &#8220;Flawless&#8221; that we had on repeat the most.



## 31. &#8220;Nightmares&#8221; by Open Mike Eagle

One of the best tracks off of his album Rappers will Die of Natural Causes, a little bit off a mellow spooky beat which fits the title perfectly.
