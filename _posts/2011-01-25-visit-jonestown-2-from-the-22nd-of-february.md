Never one to slow down the work, D-Sisive has already announced a few more details on his upcoming project, Jonestown 2. The follow up to the now free Jonestown 1, is expected to be released (probably also for free) on the 22nd of February. While you wait, why not get the [orginal](http://d-sisive.bandcamp.com/album/jonestown)?
