The bar is raised incredibly high in our penultimate entry for the Tracks of 2011.

## 20. &#8220;Specnology&#8221; by Jeff Spec

The title track from Jeff Spec&#8217;s latest effort is undeniably one of the feel good hip-hop anthems of the year as Jeff explains his thoughts on hip-hop over a crazy beat.



## 19. &#8220;Cloth&#8221; by Common

The Dreamer, The Believer serves as a resurgence for Common. On Cloth No I.D puts together a superb beat that helps Common shine.


  


## 18. &#8220;$100 Weekend&#8221; by Ugly Duckling

This track has it all, storytelling, a great beat, call backs to old Ugly Duckling tracks &#8211; the lot. 

[$100 Weekend](http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/03-100-Weekend.mp3)

## 17. &#8220;Cinemetropolis&#8221; by Blue Scholars

The opening track from Blue Scholarâ€™s album Cinemetropolis. The whole concept for how the album came about and what it stands for is given in this one track.



## 16. &#8220;Lock The Locks&#8221; by The Streets&#8221;

The final song that Mike Skinner released under The Streets guise, was a fitting send off to one the UK&#8217;s best hip-hop acts of the last decade.



## 15. &#8220;Selfish Destruction&#8221; by People Under The Stairs

Big fan of the production on this song which starts off kind of strange. Puts gives tribute to their home state and city on this track.



## 14. &#8220;Michael Jackson&#8221; by Das Racist

What is this, I don&#8217;t even.



## 13. &#8220;Six ft Over&#8221; by Cocaine 80s

A side project of producer No I.D, the Cocaine 80s combine different aspects of music. On this track, we have vintage Common.



## 12. &#8220;Survive It&#8221; by Ghostpoet

Ghostpoet&#8217;s debut this year really surprised me in so many ways. Not only did it sound like nothing unlike I&#8217;ve heard but Poet seemed incredibly comfortable on the mic and the writing was top notch. The best example of all of this, &#8220;Survive It&#8221;.



## 11. &#8220;Murder&#8221; by Cunninglynguists

Interesting track as Big K.R.I.T, Natti, and Deacon the Villain all assume the roles of different vices and rap as those vices.
