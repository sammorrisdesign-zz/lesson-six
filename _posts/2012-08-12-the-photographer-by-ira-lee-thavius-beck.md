In the past I&#8217;ve always struggled to get into Ira Lee&#8217;s work. He seems to fidget between styles too quickly for me to get into any full release he&#8217;s put out. But here&#8217;s he&#8217;s teamed with well-known alternative hip-hop producer Thavius Beck, and this track &#8220;The Photographer&#8221; is sounding great. He&#8217;s got a Aesop Rock-esque poetic quality to his lyrics and delivery on this one, and with Aesop&#8217;s recent album I thought I&#8217;d be tired of that style but Ira has put enough of a spin on it to make it work. Looking forward to hearing _Growl_ in October.
