Anticon co-founder Odd Nosdam has got his hands on &#8220;Young Sole&#8221;, a track from Sole&#8217;s longly awaited 2012 album. Loud claps and amped up guitars perfectly accompany sole&#8217;s justifiably aggressive attack of hip-hop. _A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing_ is due out on November 13th.
