Brother Ali recently sat down with the people over at Hiphopdx for a lengthy interview. I would highly highly recommend reading the full interview because Ali is able to communicate his thoughts in a very intelligent manner. Some of the answers Brother Ali gives are insightful and can really make us think about certain things. Heres a little snippet below, to read the rest head on over <a href="http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.19570/title.brother-ali-explains-mourning-in-america-and-dreaming-in-color-remembers-eyedea" target="_blank">here</a>.

**HipHopDX:** This evening you’re playing some of the new material. So, I wanted to get your take on the direction of the new album, where you feel this is taking you in your career and what kind of emotions come to mind when you think about what this is going to bring to your fans.

**Brother Ali:** Everybody talks about growth, everybody that has a long career. When this record comes out, it’ll be my sixth one and I’ve been making albums for 10 years now. I think if you look at my growth, it’s been a personal growth. I started out as a youth. You add the T.H. to the end of something and that’s what that thing is about. In your youth, you’re just all about yourself. You’re just trying to figure out how to live in the world. You’re just trying to figure it out. You’re just trying to live life. You’re really focused on self. As you start to grow, you start to think about family and eventually you start to think more about your community. Hopefully, as we grow and mature, we become more stable and the everyday living of life becomes less of a focus. You pretty much learn how to live life so then you’ve got time to focus on your family. You start to think about community and that’s where I am. If you look at _Shadows On The Sun_, I was really just focusing on trying to survive, literally, you know, starving, and living in the hood just trying to make it. That album did okay and we got some love, some support. Then, I got to a point on _Undisputed Truth_ where I was thinking more about spirituality and living the way I wanted to live. _Shadows On The Sun_ was just trying to live and then on _Undisputed Truth_, I started thinking about how I could choose how to live. That was new to me. On the _Us_ album, I started to think more about the effect that the music was having on people. I was trying to tell stories of different walks of life, trying to bring people together. On this album, it’s a little step further than that, talking about society and this kind of new, deeply democratic feeling that exists in the world. I would stop short of saying it’s going to be a political album. I don’t think it’s that. Political music talks about specific politics and policies. I think this album is really social and really talking about things that I care about in society.
