Thr3e is the third installment of Theory Hazit&#8217;s lord fire series. While some may be turned away from the religious focus that Theory Hazit and Humblebeast bring to their music, it really isn&#8217;t about that. Theory Hazit has proven himself to be a great MC, and with the production being handled on Thr3e by Dert, the whole album flows very smoothly.
