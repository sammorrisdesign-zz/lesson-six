I don&#8217;t know how I missed this one. This 12-strong brass band from Canada (like we would feature anyone else) released a five track EP late last year. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t My Style&#8221; was one of the choice tracks from it and deserves a video. Now, if you don&#8217;t mind I have some catching up to do.
