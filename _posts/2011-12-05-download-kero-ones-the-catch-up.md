We&#8217;ve always been massive fans of Kero One. In fact his 2010 release, Kinetic World, was the first thing we ever reviewed on Lesson Six. But for those not familiar with the bay&#8217;s very own Jazz rapper, Kero One has just released _The Catch Up_. It&#8217;s a free best of, featuring must have tracks from his first three albums along with a couple of rare tracks and remixes thrown in for good measure. So if you&#8217;re not familiar, you have no reason why not&#8230; [download it](http://www.mediafire.com/?4gn145bmn2flr9a)
