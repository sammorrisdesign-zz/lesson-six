A few weeks back we posted Serengeti&#8217;s &#8220;Ha-Ha&#8221; from his newly released album Family & Friends. Since then I&#8217;ve had a chance to listen to the thing in its entirely and I&#8217;ve got to admit, I&#8217;m impressed. Few are similar to Serengeti, in his flow, content and delivery and it&#8217;s rare to say that nowadays and actually mean it. Especially about someone who, for the most part, stays clich√©-free.
