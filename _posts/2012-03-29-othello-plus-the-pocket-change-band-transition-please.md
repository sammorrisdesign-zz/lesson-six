Othello has been one of my favorite mc&#8217;s since I first heard him with Lightheaded and his other solo work that he has done. In particular I am huge fan of the album he did with the Hipknotics titled Classic because of the jazz and funk production done on the album. Transition Please, Othello&#8217;s newest album, sounds eerily familiar to Classic, but with a little bit of a difference in the live band sound. You can purchase the full album on band camp.
