Despite already releasing two EPs this year, Serengeti&#8217;s 2012 isn&#8217;t over by a long shot. This track, &#8220;Amnesia&#8221;, is our first listen from C.A.R (Classic American Rap) a further collaboration with Jel & Odd Nosdam. The producer duo excellently soundtracked the Kenny Dennis EP earlier in the year, really curious to see what they can do for non-KDZ Serengeti.
