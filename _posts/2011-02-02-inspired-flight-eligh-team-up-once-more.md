I&#8217;m going to try hard not to turn this into a massive love-in for Inspired Flight. Not only because they gave me a new appreciation for born-again artist and frequently collaborator, Eligh but because they&#8217;re doing some of the most interesting things with the genre. I enjoyed a few tracks from [We All Want To Fly](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/07/review-inspired-flights-we-all-want-to-fly/), but it appears they&#8217;ve found another level. So many different genres mixed in here, so well done. Brilliant stuff. Best of all, it&#8217;s completely free if you give the fine guys of [Inspired Flight](http://www.inspiredflightmusic.com/) your e-mail address.
