I&#8217;m not sure how this happens but occasionally we hear of great releases literally just weeks in advance. More Or Les&#8217; upcoming album _Mastication_ is a great example, a few rumblings on Twitter and suddenly More Or Les has an album coming out on the 4th of September. Boom. For those unfamiliar go back through our archives and find one of my favourite tracks of the year Wordburglar&#8217;s [&#8220;Rhyme O&#8217; Clock&#8221;](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/04/rhyme-oclock-by-wordburglar/).
