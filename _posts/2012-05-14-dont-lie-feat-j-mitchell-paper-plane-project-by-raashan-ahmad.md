Maybe it&#8217;s the cynic in me, but everytime I hear yet another Raashan Ahmad track, I always go into it skeptical and leave it feeling like an idiot. The Crown City Rocker&#8217;s relentless flow of dope sounds is quickly giving [Raashan Ahmad](http://www.lessonsix.com/tag/raashan-ahmad/) the moniker of prolific. If we get more tracks like &#8220;Don&#8217;t Lie&#8221; on his upcoming album _Jewels From Jakata_, long may it continue.
