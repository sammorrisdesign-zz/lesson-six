For anyone who has been following Trebles & Blues&#8217; YouTube channel will instantly notice the step-up in locale the videos have slowly taken &#8211; From the bedroom to the most modernist looking loft you&#8217;ve ever seen. Here&#8217;s the video for the lush &#8220;808s & Quintets&#8221; from Trebles & Blues&#8217; upcoming album, due for release on the 1st of March. Sounding good so far.
