A bunch of great sampling going on here with Intuition rapping over beats by Phantogram, The Strokes &#038; Neon Indian. &#8220;I Ruined These Songs For You Too&#8221; is the follow up to last year&#8217;s free EP that featured a few less contemporary tracks. It&#8217;s a pretty good concept as sampling is starting to turn into straight up thievery, which although occasionally appropriate, can ruin a few of your favourite tracks outside the genre. At least Intuition is being polite about it.
