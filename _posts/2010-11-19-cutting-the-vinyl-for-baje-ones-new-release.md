[Last week](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/11/tiny-drill-by-baje-one-j-howells-werthman/) we featured the excellent &#8220;Tiny Drill&#8221; from the upcoming Baje One and J. Howells Werthman. I don&#8217;t know about you, but that got me really excited for the full release.

Here&#8217;s a short video from Modern Shark of them cutting into the vinyl for What&#8217;s It Gonna Be&#8217;s release at the end of the month.
