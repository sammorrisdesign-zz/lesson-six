UK&#8217;s seminal Hip-Hop producer DJ Format has kept himself busy since releasing his long-awaited third album _Statement of Intent. _He&#8217;s been straight back to producing dope hip-hop, this time for UK label Diggers With Gratitude. I&#8217;m kind of feeling the Thes One-esque filters on the Saints Remix &#8211; that gets cut in during the middle of this preview &#8211; but both cuts are great.
