Anyone who listened to &#8220;A Miraculous Kind of Machine&#8221; will instantly recognise the sounds of this track. Here Junk Science team up with Scott Through for the &#8220;First Snow&#8221; esque sounding &#8220;Pixelated&#8221;, a track that is to be featured on the full release &#8220;Phoenix Down&#8221; due for release the 31st of May. If you recognise the name that&#8217;s because Baje One (the voice of JS) teamed up with Scott last year for &#8220;What&#8217;s It Going To Be&#8221; an [album](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/11/tiny-drill-by-baje-one-j-howells-werthman/) that featured our [track of the year](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/01/best-of-2010-tracks-of-the-year-1-10/).

One to keep an eye on if there ever was one. For now, enjoy the free download.
