I&#8217;m really toying around with the idea of analysing every post and seeing where our featured artists come from. I would have said Canada would be the most featured but with the flurry of Scandinavian artists as of late, I&#8217;m not so sure. They great tracks too, really gives you an insight into a different culture that hasn&#8217;t been explored to death within this music.

Anyway, here&#8217;s &#8220;FIN&#8217; by Finland&#8217;s Freepoint Crew.
