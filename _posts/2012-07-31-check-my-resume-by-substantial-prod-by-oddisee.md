Check My Resume is the first single from Substantials upcoming album titled Home Is Where The Art Is, and this single features Oddisee handling the production. Oddisee is great as usual on the production, and Substantial sounds great on the song. He really went in on this song and if this is what the rest of the album is going to sound like, well I&#8217;m super excited.
