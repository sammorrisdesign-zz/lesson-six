Very few beat tapes and/or instrumental cd&#8217;s catch my ear and make me want to listen to the album more than one or two times. Oddisee might be one of the few producers who I can listen to over and over again because each of his tracks has a story that you can feel as you listen to it. As you listen to each track, you can start to see and feel the picture that Oddisee is trying to present of this park. Just a great overall effort and I&#8217;m looking forward to more work by Oddisee in the future. Personal favorite from this track is Mattered Much, both the instrumental and with Olivier Daysoul on the vocals.
