Found this a couple days ago, and gotta say its bangin. These guys bring a really refreshing everyman voice while also adding in a lot of emotion. Their song &#8220;Watching Over Me&#8221; is extremely powerful and it really hits home for me. Pick this EP up over here and give it a few spins, you&#8217;re bound to enjoy it.
