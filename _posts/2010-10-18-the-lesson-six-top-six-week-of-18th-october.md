Someone was slacking last week and I apologise for that, tut-tut. Here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s review inspired Top Six.

<!--more-->

## Pigeon John &#8211; Before We&#8217;re Gone

Pigeon John has always been someone I&#8217;m about to get into. That&#8217;s why when his new album Dragon Slayer popped up last week, I jumped at the chance to finally cross another off the list.



## 7L &#038; Esoteric &#8211; I Hate Flying

I&#8217;m probably paraphrasing the review I haven&#8217;t written yet but when these guys have a concept, they do it justice. It&#8217;s a shame they specialise in battle rap rather than stuff like this.



## Atmosphere &#8211; The Number None

I don&#8217;t know how this story is already an Atmosphere track.



## People Under The Stairs &#8211; Time To Rock Our Shit

Let&#8217;s end this week&#8217;s Top Six with some classics. I&#8217;ve recently spent a bit of time going back through discographies and finding the early albums of a few select artists.



## Ugly Duckling &#8211; Now Who&#8217;s Laughing

Some really early Ugly Duckling here, from their Fresh Mode EP.



## The Wiseguys &#8211; Start The Commotion

Anyone remember this?
