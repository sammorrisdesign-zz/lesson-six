Now this seems like an interesting project. Defcon 5, Doug Masters,  DJ Adamnt of The West Indies and DJ Shag of Joint Response have teamed up to produce Entertainment, an album that is structured around the artists favourite films.

The hard thing is finding when and where this album was released. I keep finding conflicting reports that say either last year or this year. If you know then please drop us some lovely comments below as we would love to review it.
