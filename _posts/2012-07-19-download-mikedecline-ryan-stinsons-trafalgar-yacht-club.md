Mikedecline & Ryan Stinson are two Canadian producers, the latter you might remember produced a [free album](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/09/by-my-side-by-chapter-thrive-ryan-stinson/) for Chapter Thrive a couple of years back, who have been paired together for a joint 7&#8243; by Phonographique. For those not into vinyl, you can get the four summer instrumentals on [Bandcamp](http://music.phonographique.com/album/trafalgar-yacht-club) in a pay-what-you-want-deal. Either that or you can just buy the shirt on the album cover.
