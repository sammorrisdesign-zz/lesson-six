First track off Lushlife&#8217;s new album, _Plateau Vision_, has our attention. Lushlife drops sporadic references through the three minutes of &#8220;Big Sur&#8221; over laidback guitar filled production. Album is set to drop April 17th but in the meantime, you can, and probably should, get this track from [his Bandcamp](http://lushlifemedia.bandcamp.com/).
