From the moment that I first heard of the 49ers I was hooked to their jazzy soulful sound with meaningful lyrics. For the past couple months I had heard rumors of something new with the 49ers, but this EP came out of nowhere to surprise myself. The production on this three track EP really stands out from the standard jazzy production on many beat tapes now a days. This is one EP where you can just sit there and vibe out to it for hours even though there are only three tracks.
