During the late 90s LA lead a fightback against a settling mainstream, headed up by groups like Dilated Peoples. While the trio of Rakaa, DJ Babu & Evidence have been busy working on their own stuff recently, they&#8217;re working somewhere on a follow up to 2006&#8242;s _20/20_. Their fifth LP _Directors of Photography_ is pegged for a 2013 release as they start to play a few more shows as a group again.

&#8220;The wait for a new group album hasn&#8217;t really seemed that long to us. In fact, being in the studio forÂ _Directors of Photography_ feels right on time&#8221; said Rakaa.

Which is probably true, while it&#8217;s been six years, they&#8217;ve each been busy on their own stuff to [mixed results](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/07/review-rakaas-crown-of-thorns/). After pumping out 4 albums in 6 years, their style didn&#8217;t get much time to evolve, let&#8217;s hope the break has done them good.
