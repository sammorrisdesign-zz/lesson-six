First single from Awon & Kameleon Beats newest album, and this is a good one. I got a chance to listen to the unfinished version of the project earlier, and I can say for sure that this is going to be a good one. There is a really clear evolution in the sound from Kameleon Beats, especially sample wise, and Awon as always is a great story teller.
