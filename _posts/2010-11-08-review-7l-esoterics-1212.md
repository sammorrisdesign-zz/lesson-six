One of the first things we featured on **Lesson Six** was a the result of _Esoteric_ and his 18 month old son messing around in the studio. It was playful, funny and hopefully a sign of things to come. _7L & Esoteric_ usually deliver semi-listenable brag and battle rap for those with open-mind for the occasionally clichéd &#8211; _1212_ in those respects is nothing new.

<!--more-->Although that paints a picture of throwaway tracks with little meaning, 

_1212_ does serve up a handful of quality tracks. &#8220;I Hate Flying&#8221; proves that when they get conceptual, they have the talent to deliver and ultimately shows the missing potential throughout the rest of _1212_. Meanwhile, &#8220;New Rapper&#8221; is pure brag-rap but with a underlying concept and proves to be a humorous highlight of the album.

> Allow me to be Frank like Zappa / Most of dudes I hear today, they smell of fecal matter

Those are the highlights of the album as the rest ventures in the clichéd and feels like underground rap trying to sound like mainstream rap. While _Esoteric_ frequently comments on the poor state of commercial rap, he isn&#8217;t afraid to mimic it and pay homage to it frequently. The guestlist of featured artists further backs this up, _Inspectah Deck, Statik Selektah_ and _Ill Bill_ all give enough warning of what _1212_ is trying to achieve.

To be fair, _7L&#8217;s_ production is solid throughout but it simply fails to distract from _Esoteric&#8217;s_ played out lyricism. While I could dissect the lack of merit behind most of the tracks, I won&#8217;t. This stuff has an audience but not one you&#8217;ll find on **Lesson Six**. While a handful of the more conceptual tracks entertain, the majority of _1212_ feels like filler brag-rap and ticks too many clichés while doing so.
