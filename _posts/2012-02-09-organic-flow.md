Hip-Hop at its core is spoken word poetry accompanied by a beat. Organic Flow may sound strange to many who listen to more &#8220;traditional&#8221; hip-hop, but this is the type of music we love to share. The live instrumentation also really adds depth, instead of the now more than ever common production from computer based production.
