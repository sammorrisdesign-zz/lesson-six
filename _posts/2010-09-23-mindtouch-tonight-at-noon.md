I&#8217;m no expert on the ins-and-outs of recording, I&#8217;m just a listener and a lover. So instead of trying to describe the details of the recording, I&#8217;ll just quote the man.

&#8220;All analogue. No quantize. 10-15 seconds sample time. One floppy, one beat. All tracks created with an Mpc 3000 and an Sp404&#8243;

The album is really nice, stripped down with a great feel. Looking forward to hearing more from the unknown man from Korea.
