Jurassic 5 are obviously essential to the site as we got our name from one of their songs. Other than that, they perfectly fit the ideals of cliché free Hip Hop. Made up of four MC&#8217;s and two DJ&#8217;s, they formed in the late 90&#8242;s and released their first album in &#8217;98. After four albums they broke up in &#8217;07, although all the members are still collaborating with other artists, touring and producing some quality material.

## Great Expectations

_From the album, Quality Control._



I _think_ this is the first track I heard. Definitely one of them. The beat is classic J5; brash, loud, almost simple in it&#8217;s purpose: to make you move. I love the way each MC takes turns on the verses and comes back together for the chorus, it&#8217;s one of the staples of the J5 sound, &#8220;Big, bad, and bold, b-boys of old.&#8221;

## Lausd

_From the album, Quality Control._



A great track that proves how they fit in with the ethics of lesson6. Forget the fame, money and big cars, these guys did it for the fans, and their love of Hip-hop.

## Lesson6 &#8211; The Lecture

_From the album, Jurassic 5 LP._



No vocals but a great tune that shows how good DJ Nu Mark and Cut Chemist are. They may not have  the laid back style of some other DJ&#8217;s, but they really could lay down a distinctive beat and mix in some really unique samples.

## What&#8217;s Golden

_From the album, Power In Numbers._



This track pretty much sums up why I love Jurassic 5. Every member is on the ball, from the beats to the rhymes, I just, yeah, I really do love it. Chali 2na&#8217;a opening line still amazes me no matter how many times I hear it: &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s the verbal Herman Munster. The word enhancer.&#8221;

## We Know Something You Don&#8217;t Know (DJ Format feat. J5)

_From the album, Music For The Mature B-Boy._



How about I leave you with a smile? It&#8217;s a great video, one that, oddly enough, I remember seeing on P Rock &#8211; the channel this video was captured on. You can&#8217;t really go wrong with a mix of Jurassic 5 and DJ Format.
