My music folder and YouTube favourites list is full of random artists and tracks that I&#8217;ve favourited, bought, found, downloaded, to digest at a a later date. Problem is, that later date never comes. You have to make the time. And this week I will. I&#8217;ll listen to every random track I have and decide what&#8217;s worthy of a purchase. So with that in mind here&#8217;s my Top Six artists that I need to listen to.

## El Da Sensei &#8211; Crowd Pleasa

Wandered across this track last week while browsing throught some fellow hip-hop blogs. It packs a great beat and I think I&#8217;m going to have to give the album a listen.
  


## Binary Star &#8211; Conquistadors

I first heard &#8220;Reality Check&#8221; awhile back on a _Halo 2_ montage of all things. I liked it, picked up the album and it just sat there until now when I was reminded of it. It&#8217;s good, as I&#8217;m sure many readers will know.
  


## Lyrics Born &#8211; Callin&#8217; Out

I know, I know, how am I not in love with _Lyrics Born_? I&#8217;ve heard of the guy, heard his songs, heard on him other albums, but just never sat down and listened to him. This will be fixed this week, for sure.
  


## Benefit &#8211; Something Wicked This Way Comes

Another random tune that I came across on YouTube. The beat at the start of the song is flawless.
  


## The West Indies &#8211; S.D. Nights

Not sure if this is _Spearman_ featuring _The West Indies_, or _The West Indies_ featuring _Spearman_, or God knows what else, but I do know that I like it.
  


## Collective Efforts &#8211; Crazy Things

First heard this group on the surprisingly good Xbox 360 game, _Amped 3_. The soundtrack features a bunch of artists including _Psyche Origami_ ([Great tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAI35tkih9o&p=493B3EE35087B136&index=2&playnext=1)), who almost made the list. I remember just leaving my character standing at the bottom of the slopes and enjoying the tunes.
