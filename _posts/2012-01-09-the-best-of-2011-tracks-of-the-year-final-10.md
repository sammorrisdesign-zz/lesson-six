Before we move onto our albums and free downloadable of the year (along with a few guestlists), we&#8217;ve got the little matter of our top 10 tracks of 2011.

<!--more-->

## 10. &#8220;Saturday Love&#8221; by Junk Science

OK, so technically this track was recorded in 2006, but since it was only released in 2011, we think it still qualifies. Plus, it sounds dope. One of the bonus tracks, off Junk Science&#8217;s retro game inspired release Phoenix Down, easily overshadowed the concept album with it&#8217;s great sampling.

[Saturday Love (Secret Old Nuk Fam &#038; Javelin Track From Like 2006)](http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/07-Saturday-Love-Secret-Old-Nuk-Fam-Javelin-Track-From-Like-2006.mp3)

## 9. &#8220;Ox y Moron&#8221; by One Be Lo

One Be Lo came back to the scene strong with Labor, great track about the effects of what money and greed can do.



## 8. &#8220;Omar Don&#8217;t Scare&#8221; by Milo

This entire release was filled with great quoteables but Milo&#8217;s opener probably took it for me. Yes, it&#8217;s only two minutes long, but picking quote worthy lines would basically leave me re-posting the entire lyrics. 



## 7. &#8220;The Good Fight&#8221; by Phonte

The Good Fight is a track about the regular, everyday man from Phonte’s album Charity Starts at Home



## 6. &#8220;Left Foot, Right Foot&#8221; by People Under The Stairs

It&#8217;s still criminal that this track was tagged with &#8220;bonus track&#8221; on People Under The Stair&#8217;s 2011 release. Another one of their feel good end-of-albumers, doesn&#8217;t skimp on positivity.

## 5. &#8220;Jack Kerouac&#8221; by Tiron & Ayomari

From A Sucker for Pumps, Jack Kerouac and the whole album is about love.



## 4. &#8220;The Crown&#8221; by The Good Sin & 10.4 Rog

Sometimes tracks come along that make you take notice. The Good Sin &#038; 10.4 Rog produced an entire EP that made us take notice, and it was free. Rog&#8217;s sparse but soulful production was enough but The Good Sin&#8217;s positive energy and quotables kept us coming back for more.



## 3. &#8220;Black In America&#8221; by Awon & Kameleon Beats

Awon really blossomed as a storyteller on Concentration Gradient helped by the jazzy beats of Kameleon Beats. Black In America is a track that outlines many of the problems that blacks face in America.



## 2. &#8220;Oskar Barnack Oscar Grant&#8221; by Blue Scholars

The standout track from Blue Scholars latest album Cinemetropolis. You can forget about political correctness in this track, and instead you get to hear Geo inform the audience about issues you may not think about regularly.



## 1. &#8220;Are We There Yet?&#8221; by Dumbfoundead

Dumbfoundead&#8217;s quest for a record deal took his 2011 to mixed places. On one hand it had a bunch of cliché-ridden tracks about weed, but then on the other hand it had this beast. One verse about his mum, one about his girlfriend, one about his choice of career &#8211; here Dumbfoundead gives you a pretty comprehensive retrospective of his life in under four minutes. A track concept so good, so simple but really well executed. An example of cliché-free hip-hop at it&#8217;s finest.
