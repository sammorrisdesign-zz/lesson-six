I&#8217;ve been meaning to post the follow up to the excellent _[Hermitage Academy](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/01/aretha-by-safari-al/)_ for a long time now. His _Highlands EP_ has been out for a week on [Bandcamp](http://blackchalk.bandcamp.com/album/highlands-ep) and anything The Whethermen post deserves more than that. Safari Al luckily sent me the best reminder in the form of the well shot visuals for &#8220;Windswept&#8221; that tell a great story.
