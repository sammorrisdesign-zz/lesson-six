Fresh off his split 7&#8243; release with Ryan Stinson, Canadian producer Mikedecline has just released an album of more experimental beats called _Mood Soop._ Rather than just being an collection of beats that he had lying around and decided to release, Mikedecline made these beats with the theme of emotions during Winter in mind. Check out the atmospheric &#8220;The Sun, The Shadow&#8221; below and then head over to the Phonographique Bandcamp and grab the rest of the album on a name-your-price deal.
