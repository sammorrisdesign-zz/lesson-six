    Retirement, hatred and suicidal thoughts are just a few of the words being thrown around when talking about Lupe Fiasco’s oft-delayed release, ‘Lasers’ – just few would have predicted that they would be coming from Lupe himself. However, it’s not at all surprising when your record label has you sounding like a poor man’s B.O.B.

    The truth is that for all the well documented meddling Atlantic Records have had with Lupe’s third release, it’s still better than most mainstream hip-hop. Not that this excuses the fact that, bar a few tracks like “All Black Everything” & “Beautiful Lasers”, this album lacks message and heart. Anyone who listens to ‘Lasers’ will still recognise someone in these short glimpses as the breath of fresh air we heard on ‘The Cool’ and the amazing debut in ‘Food & Liquor’. This alone should be enough to spark interest for his next release if, pray, he’s given the creative freedom his first two albums undoubtedly deserved. For now though voting against this with your dollars is the best way of giving him that freedom to return to form.
