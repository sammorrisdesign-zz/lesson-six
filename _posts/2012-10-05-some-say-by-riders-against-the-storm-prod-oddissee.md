RAS took Clara Burton, a standout track from Oddisee&#8217;s Rock Creek Park which came out last year and added some great vocals too it. I&#8217;ve been waiting for some one to take the quality tracks from the Rock Creek Park EP and do this, but I haven&#8217;t seen any that sounded remotely close to being good.
