Like we need another hip-hop track about trainers, right? Actually, wait up, this one actually has a point to it and an incredibly well produced and realised video. It&#8217;s taken awhile but the video for _Macklemore&#8217;s &#8220;Wings&#8221;_ is finally out and boy was it worth the wait. In fact, just watch it and then get amped for the full album coming later this year.
