Sometimes a big beat comes along that reminds you how good Hip-Hop can be. I remember the same happening with Shad&#8217;s &#8220;Yaa I Get It&#8221; last year, those tracks that are just big. This feels like one, by way of Toronto based, Notes of Self. Who happen to have a new album coming later this month.
