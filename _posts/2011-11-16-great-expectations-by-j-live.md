Last month, J-Live finally released his long-awaited album, S.P.T.A and unsurprisingly, it&#8217;s pretty decent. Although I don&#8217;t think he pushed the intriguing split-personality concept we first heard on [Undivided Attention](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/11/review-j-lives-undivided-attention-ep/) as far as he could have, its still one of his best. And the best of the best, is easily Great Expectations where J-Live puts a few things in perspective.
