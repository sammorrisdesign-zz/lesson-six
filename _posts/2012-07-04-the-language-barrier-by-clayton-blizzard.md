Some more UK Hip-Hop, this time by political folk-hop rapper Clayton Blizzard. I&#8217;ve been interested in Clayton&#8217;s unique combination of folk and hip-hop ever since I heard [&#8220;Economics 101&#8243;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWGDzm8IRjw) a few years back. Here he explores language and words in &#8220;The Language Barrier&#8221; off his new album [_Analogue Is Better Than Digital_](http://claytonblizzard.bandcamp.com/album/analogue-is-better-than-digital).
