I&#8217;ve never really been able to get into Clemits. As strange as that sentence is for a blog post about him. He&#8217;s got this weird and slow monotone flow that only works on specific tracks. But I&#8217;ve got high hopes for his upcoming November albumÂ _Skeleton Crew_ after watching the visuals for &#8220;Boutique Shop&#8221;, he&#8217;s really improving his unique craft.
