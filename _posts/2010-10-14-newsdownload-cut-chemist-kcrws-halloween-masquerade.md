Are you from LA? Do you dig _Cut Chemist_ and things that go bump in the night? Then get yourself some tickets to [KCRW&#8217;s Halloween Masquerade](http://www.kcrw.com/events/masquerade-2010). You&#8217;ll be able to hear _[Sound of The Police](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/08/review-cut-chemists-sound-of-the-police/)_ live as well as &#8220;Explore your inner ghoul in style with five uniquely themed rooms, dance to music on four stages by 13 KCRW DJs, lose yourself in the wild wonderworld of Vaudeville circus troupe Lucent Dossier, and dine at a handful of frightfully tasty artisan food truck&#8221;

And if you can&#8217;t go then you should at least [download](http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/10/masquerade-performers-announced-w-exclusive-free-downloads/) this free b-side from Cut Chemist (as well as free tracks from The Duke Spirit and Glam Rabbit &#8211; not hip-hop, but good none the less).
