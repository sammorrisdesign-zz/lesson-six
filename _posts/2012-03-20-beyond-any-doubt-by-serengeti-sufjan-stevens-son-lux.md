Today saw _Beak &#038; Claw_, the hopefully first of many, finally get it&#8217;s anticipated release. s/s/s, also known as, Lesson Six favourite and allround 2012-killer, Serengeti teams up with Son Lux &#038; Sufjan Stevens on this short but sweet four-track EP. If for whatever, reason you aren&#8217;t already on the [Anticon Bandcamp](http://anticon.bandcamp.com/) downloading this, you need to listen to the outstanding &#8220;Beyond Any Doubt&#8221;.
