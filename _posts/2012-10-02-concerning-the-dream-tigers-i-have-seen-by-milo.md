It&#8217;s been too long since we&#8217;ve last heard Milo get all introspective on a beat most rappers would never think about touching. &#8220;Concerning the Dream Tigers I Have Seen&#8221; is exactly that, with slightly different mixing on the vocals that, if anything, actually suit the track. Excited for his full release, presumably coming early next year.
