Marcus D the producer behind Bop Alloy is getting set to release his 2nd full length instrumental album. Ever since hearing the production on the Bop Alloy album, Substantial and Marcus D have been on steady rotation on my ipod. Marcus D has a distinct jazzy flavor to his tracks which are influenced by the late Nujabes and many other great producers. His work on other tracks released on a few different compilations this year caught my ear. Through kickstarter, a few people were able to get a copy of Melancholy Prequel. Heres a track to get you excited for the upcoming album.
