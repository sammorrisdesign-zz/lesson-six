I&#8217;ve never really dabbled with any kind of foreign language hip-hop but when the beats are this good, I&#8217;m starting to wonder why. Not that this is purely about the beats, the rhyming and wordplay is still impressive despite being in a language I don&#8217;t understand. Slightly weird that one. Anyway here&#8217;s Hocus Pocus with &#8220;Equilibré&#8221; or &#8220;Balance&#8221; if you want your French Hip-Hop track titles to be in English.
