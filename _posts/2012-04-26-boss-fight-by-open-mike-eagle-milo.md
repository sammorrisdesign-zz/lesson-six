Tracks about video games play a risky game but self-confessed nerd rappers Open Mike Eagle & Milo lend themselves well to the subject on &#8220;Boss Fight&#8221;. The track, off Open Mike&#8217;s recently released free [Rent Party Extension EP](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?5zcesw3k88cuc5r), features an organic sounding collaboration taking turns reminiscing about their favourite past-time over the kind of dirty-sounding synth that Milo feels at home on. Bleeps & electronic vocals pepper the beat while both throw off Rez & Final Fight references like it&#8217;s nothing. Highly anticipating anything these guys together in the future.
