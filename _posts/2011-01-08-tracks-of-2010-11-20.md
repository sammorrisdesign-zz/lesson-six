The countdown continues and we&#8217;re nearly there. Here&#8217;s our list of tracks that just missed out on the top ten.

<!--more-->

## 20. Inspired Flight &#8211; It&#8217;s The Chemicals



## 19. Elaquent &#8211; Mastered System



## 18. Pigeon John &#8211; Rock Bottom Again

## You&#8217;ll have to take our word on this one as we can&#8217;t find his or most of the other tracks from his new album Dragon Slayer, on the internet. We swear we saw it on Spotify at one point and it definitely was on YouTube because we posted it but they seem to have vanished. Also his Twitter account has stopped since the 5th of December. Have you seen Pigeon John?

## 17. D-sisive &#8211; West Coast



## 16. Eligh &#8211; Find yourself



## 15. Incise &#8211; A New Day



## 14. Nieve &#8211; Troubles Of The Past



## 13. Capitol 1212 &#8211; Good Feelin&#8217;



## 12. Shad &#8211; Yaa I Get It



## 11. Junk Science &#8211; Fire Drill
