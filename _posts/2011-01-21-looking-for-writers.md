For the regular followers of the blog, you might have noticed a few changes around here. Although the previous site was functional we weren&#8217;t entirely happy with the feel of the site. Now that we&#8217;ve gone quote happy, we would like to keep the ball rolling through 2011.

We&#8217;re always looking to expand and would like to add to our writing team. We&#8217;re currently a UK based publication but we&#8217;re looking to welcome anyone good enough to join the site. All that&#8217;s required is knowledge of the type of hip-hop we cover, decent writing skills & a little free time.

If this sounds like something you would be up for send us an email to staff@lessonsix.com

We look forward to hearing from you
