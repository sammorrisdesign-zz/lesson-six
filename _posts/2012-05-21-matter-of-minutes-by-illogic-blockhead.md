Fresh off his recently released solo release, Interludes After Midnight, Blockhead is teaming up with Illogic on a little EP due out on 5th of June. The visual abstraction for &#8220;Matter of Minutes&#8221;, off the Preparing For Capture EP, are really appropriate here. Looking forward to hearing more.
