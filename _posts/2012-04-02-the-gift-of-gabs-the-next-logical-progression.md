This is a release that came up and surprised me. It&#8217;s so hard to keep up with the hundreds of different artists I enjoy, but none the less it is awesome when a new album comes out from an artist you haven&#8217;t heard from in a while. The backstory behind the album is also very interesting and you can read about the struggles that Gab and his family have been going through <a href="http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2012/03/gift_of_gab_diabetes_diagnosis_the_next_logical_progression.php" target="_blank">here</a>. You can purchase the album on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-next-logical-progression/id507782558" target="_blank">iTunes</a>.
