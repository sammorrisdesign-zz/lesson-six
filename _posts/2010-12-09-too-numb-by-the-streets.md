I&#8217;ve been a little unsure on The Streets as of late. I&#8217;m managed to find a zip file full of tracks he released on Twitter earlier in the year and wasn&#8217;t convinced with it all. However, the tracks that have stood tall, we&#8217;ve been (or we will) post here on L6 because a handful of them are brilliant.

This selection of tracks was due to, or at least some of them were, appear on his forthcoming album Computers and Blues. That was until last week where he talked about how forigen and old those sound to him now. So he&#8217;s now releasing Cyberspace and Reds. Our first listen of it comes in the form of &#8220;Too Numb&#8221; Like most things on his YouTube channel, it&#8217;s very reactionary to recently developments. Namely, the weather that&#8217;s snowed in most of the UK.

It&#8217;s a little odd because this doesn&#8217;t sound like polished album material, it sounds a lot like the normal YouTube tracks he creates. It all seems like a reaction to the ease in which you can post content online and instantly share it across the world. Not saying anything bad about what&#8217;s coming out of the channel so far, but it will be interesting to see what gets released come February.
