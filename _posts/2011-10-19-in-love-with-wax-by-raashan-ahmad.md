Haven&#8217;t seen this one getting too much love across the blogs. It&#8217;s a shame because I thought that Raashan Ahmad&#8217;s 2010 album, &#8220;For What You&#8217;ve Lost&#8221;, was one of the best of last year. Well produced jazzy-beats and forward thinking lyrics are tough to turn down around these parts. Anyway, here&#8217;s the video for &#8220;In Love With Wax&#8221; from that same album.
