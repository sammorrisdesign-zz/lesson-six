This is an interesting one. Rhymesayers are continuing their excellent run of form by announcing a flood of information about P.O.S&#8217; return in _We Don&#8217;t Even Live Here_. It&#8217;s coming out on the 23rd of October, but the more interesting details come in the form of guest spots on the album. Bon Iver&#8217;s Justin Vernon is interesting, Boyz Noise & Housemeister are intriguing. In the meantime though here&#8217;s the first single &#8220;Bumper&#8221;.
