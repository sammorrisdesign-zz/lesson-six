Freddie Joachim is fast becoming one of my favorite producers alongside Oddisee to listen too. This track is the first single of his upcoming album titled Fiberglass Kisses. The soulful singing of Carlitta Durand blends perfectly with the jazz infused production from Freddie Joachim. There is also a remix of the track from London based producer Eric Lau, and it sounds great as well.
