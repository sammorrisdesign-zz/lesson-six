When producers branch out and release their own album, they tend to fall flat. Through no fault of their own, I mean when the producers take this right of passage they normally deliver great beats. However that top-notch production is usually paired with strangled rappers who never really get the room to explore the subjects we like here at Lesson Six. However, that&#8217;s where Incise differs. Armed with a roster of self-proclaimed conscience rappers, Incise undoubtedly delivers one of the soundtracks to the summer.

<!--more-->Daily Method&#8217;s makes no attempts to hide what it is. The opening handful of tracks set the scene with confident rappers over jazzy laid beat summer beats. They aren&#8217;t bad but they&#8217;re only the bread of the album, it&#8217;s the beef in the middle that reveals how extraordinary this solo outing is. &#8220;Bring It Back&#8221; is a throwback to the origins of the genre and eventually turns into a statement on what needs to happen going forward. Another notable &#8220;Paving The Way&#8221;, features a brilliantly compiled trio, of Okay City, David Morin and Lesson Six posterchild Shad K, exploring why their music isn&#8217;t about the cookie-cutter clichÃ©s.

> Kick off the sheets, the summer heat&#8217;s got me sweating / Turn up this beat, help me ease with the stressing / Open up the blinds realise that I&#8217;m blessed with life / Bright future in sight

The crew that Incise has gathered doesn&#8217;t leave much room for instrumentals. Only three of the fifteen tracks are purely instrumental, simply called &#8220;Sunrise&#8221;, &#8220;Midday&#8221; & &#8220;Sunset&#8221;. These tracks evenly separate the rest of the album and explain the name, Daily Methods. The best, &#8220;Midday&#8221; is immediately followed by the stand-out track. Unknown rapper Ajaxx reflects on the trials and tribulations of being an unknown rapper and ironically is probably the only name you&#8217;ll take from Daily Methods.

That&#8217;s not to say that features by Shad K, The Stereotypes & the army of unknowns aren&#8217;t as good, just not as memorable after listening to fifteen different artists. The diversity in personnel is an excellent reason why anyone should pick this up. You&#8217;re bound to find something new. However, it works both ways. The chances are that at least one of the guest-spots won&#8217;t be to your fancy.

Don&#8217;t let that put you off though, this isn&#8217;t a record label sampler. Incise serves up a showcase of familiar and unknown rappers. More importantly, however, Incise provides a brilliant platform of quality music. Laid-back beats infused with jazz are just what the doctor ordered for those longer summertime days at home and Incise delivers them in droves. If you&#8217;re looking for a soundtrack to your summer that isn&#8217;t our free mixcloud, then you&#8217;ve come to the right place. I&#8217;m just sorry that I didn&#8217;t find it at that the start of the season.

_Daily Methods was released at the right time, the 2nd of June. Unfortunately we slept on this one for too long. Don&#8217;t make the same mistake and get it on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/daily-methods/id373546202)._
