We&#8217;re trying a slightly different format this week because, quite simply, fourteen into six doesn&#8217;t go. That&#8217;s why we have had to give fourteen-piece band My Son The Hurricane a track per person over two weeks with the second half coming next week.

**The Band:** One of the best things about being in a band like ours is always finding new music. Anytime we get together someone says something like &#8220;Hey have you checked out&#8230;&#8221; and it goes from there. When we&#8217;re on the road, we break out the iPods and old CD&#8217;s and play what we&#8217;re into. Last time we were on the road we heard everything from Mongolian throat singing to Ice T&#8217;s metal band, Body Count. We&#8217;re just getting ready to hit the road with D-Sisive at the end of April, and here&#8217;s some of the stuff we&#8217;re digging right now

# &#8220;Dead Bent&#8221; by MF Doom



**Jacob Bergsma (Emcee)**: During the winter I find myself with fewer recreational activities, and over the years I&#8217;ve grown to appreciate an early rise. But if ever I&#8217;m in need of a quick recovery, this is one of the songs that takes my ass off the washroom floor and back into my long underwear.

# &#8220;How Many Mics&#8221; by The Fugees



**Boichuk (Tenor Sax):** I&#8217;ve been listening to this album everyday this month. Super dope. I can&#8217;t get over L&#8217;s rhymes, she is something else.

# &#8220;Black Venom&#8221; by The Budos Band



**Fraser Gauthier (Bass):** Dudes who look like they might race cafe bikes by day and man-up to the afro-beats by night are coming back in big way. Nice horn lines, no jazz hats required.

# &#8220;Symphony no. 8 3rd Movement&#8221; by Anton Bruckner



**Elburz Sorkhabi (Trombone):** Bruckner&#8217;s Apocalypse symphony is one of my favourite pieces ever created, and with Karajan at the orchestral helm, the emotional intensity of the piece is magnified to an almost debilitating point.

# &#8220;Young Cardinals&#8221; by Alexisonfire



**Brian Walters (Trumpet):** Solid canadian band that grew from a strictly screamo outfit finally matured with this album. Love the heaviness mixed with tight harmonies&#8230; as a trumpet player who is a huge rock music fan, it&#8217;s my favorite sort of situation to be in as a player.

# &#8220;Cooler As Ekke&#8221; by Jack Parow



**Ewan Divitt (Trumpet / Sousaphone):** I have been listening to Jack Parow pretty much non stop for a few months. His beats and flow are amazing.
