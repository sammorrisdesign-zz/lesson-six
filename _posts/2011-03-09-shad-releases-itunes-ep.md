Before we set up shop, Shad released a video where he rapped in front of a garage for a quick promotional video. This previously unreleased track features on a new [iTunes Session EP](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/itunes-session-ep/id419783767) along with a bunch of live recordings of tracks we&#8217;re more familiar with. This might as well serve as a great introduction to our album of 2010 winner. Get on it.
