I&#8217;m not sure if this is one we knew about already but a video featuring Thes One and cohorts working on a new album entitled, Wonderful Radio. The only other bits of information we have is that it&#8217;s pegged for Summer 2011 and features an accordion. Seems like a pretty big production based on this video. Expect more to come soon&#8230;
