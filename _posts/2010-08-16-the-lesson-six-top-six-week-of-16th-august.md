It&#8217;s Monday and we&#8217;ve got another six tracks for your aural pleasure. I say we, but it&#8217;s more me, as this is my first one. I hope there&#8217;s something in here that you like; if there&#8217;s not then do no fear, as it&#8217;ll be Sam&#8217;s turn again next week.

## Gorillaz &#8211; Superfast JellyFish (feat. De La Soul and Gruff Rhys)

My favourite song off the brilliant new Gorillaz album. I mean, where else would you hear _De La Soul_ and the lead singer of the _Superfunny Animals_ on the same song?



## Blackalicious &#8211; First In Flight (feat. Gils Scott Heron)

I love the vocals from _Gils Scott Heron_, it just sets up the whole song. It&#8217;s almost perfect.



## Homeboy Sandman &#8211; The Carpenter

I think I&#8217;m in love with this man. Seriously! He has such an impressive flow &#8211; fast but clever &#8211;  and it&#8217;s filled with so much information that you&#8217;ll still be noticing things on your 12th listen.



## D-sisive &#8211; Boom Baba Boom

Very laid back tune that perfectly shows off his storytelling skills &#8211; funny, too.



## Handsome Boy Modelling School &#8211; Holy Calamity

You may have figured out that I have a bit of a passion for big, beefy beats.



## Elaquent &#8211; Cloud 8

This is good, is it not? I just wish I could find a video of Mastered System so I could have ended this with some 8 bit instrumental magic.
