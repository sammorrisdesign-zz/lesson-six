As far as trends go, this new brand of is-it-or-isn&#8217;t it atmospheric hip-hop, seems to be sticking around. Ever since _Flying Lotus_ burst onto the scene some of my favourite sites have been inundated with the same style of music and personally I&#8217;ve stayed well clear. Then I saw the amazing artwork, created by _Teebs_ himself, for _Ardour_. While it was definitely a materialistic move, it was what brought me to this new innovative trend-setting form of music &#8211; something I&#8217;m glad I tried.

<!--more-->However, unlike the artwork itself, there is little to sink your teeth into on 

_Ardour_. The experimentally sparse production throughout is, just about, brilliant as ambiance, writing music or just something that simply isn&#8217;t your usual fare. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, tracks like &#8220;Why Like&#8221; and &#8220;Arthur&#8217;s Birds&#8221; are beautiful but _Ardour_ will be too experimental for some. While it doesn&#8217;t stray too far from the trend-setters, there are _a lot_ of ideas going on here.

Only a handful of the eighteen different tracks will jump out at you but ultimately that&#8217;s what lets _Ardour_ down. While all the tracks feel unique, none of them are catchy enough. That&#8217;s not to say that _Teebs_ isn&#8217;t a clever man or that he doesn&#8217;t create great music. A lot of _Ardour_ is completely solid, it&#8217;s just quantity of quality that reigns supreme throughout.
