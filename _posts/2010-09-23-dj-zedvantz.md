Let&#8217;s kick off Instrumental Thursday with a bang. A jazzy bang. This album is only one track long but you get a lot for your download as it&#8217;s 35 minutes of jazz loops. It moves from sample to sample, bounces from horn to horn, and keeps things expertly chilled.

Thanks to [Musical Schizophreni](http://musicalschizophrenia.blogspot.com/)a for the heads up
