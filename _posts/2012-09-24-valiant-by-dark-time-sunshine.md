Dark Time Sunshine&#8217;s excellent ANX is rapidly becoming my favourite pleasant surprise of 2012. It wasn&#8217;t on my radar at all until a series of great [video](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/08/never-cry-wolf-by-dark-time-sunshine/)s to successfully experimental hip-hop came my way. &#8220;Valiant&#8221; now becoming another to add to that list.
