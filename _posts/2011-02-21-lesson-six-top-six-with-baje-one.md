Every Monday we get an artist we normally feature to pick their recently listened playlist. This week we&#8217;ve got Modern Shark & Junk Science&#8217;s Baje One selecting an appropriately wide selection of tracks in his self-titled, &#8220;Life, Liberty &#038; the Pursuit of Happiness Mix&#8221;.

## &#8220;Gymnop√©die&#8221; by Erik Satie



Scott Thorough put me on to Erik Satie. His stuff was meant to be played as background music. I like the humility in that, especially since so many musicians are egomaniacs.

## &#8220;FYI&#8221; by Jay Electronica



I had something resembling a religious experience the first time I saw Eternal Sunshine. Anybody else would&#8217;ve fucked this (mixtape) idea up. Jay Electronica did the right thing here.

## &#8220;Offline&#8221; by Cool Calm Pete



Cool Calm Pete is such a good rapper. Also, he gave me his old iphone, which was very nice of him.

## &#8220;Pursuit of Happiness&#8221; by Kid Cudi



The Megaforce Version of the video for this song is a very accurate visual representation of how I feel some days. Such a good chorus.

## &#8220;Radioactive&#8221; by Cee-Lo Green



This song gets stuck in the sticky parts of my brain. Shout out to Alex Snook and Eddy Way.

## &#8220;Tap The Phone&#8221; by Francis & The Lights



Another sticky song. I love this whole album actually. I met Francis at a party recently and we had an awkward conversation.

_And that&#8217;s another artist selected top six. Next KWES will be in the booth selecting his playlist (with no Jay Electronia)_
