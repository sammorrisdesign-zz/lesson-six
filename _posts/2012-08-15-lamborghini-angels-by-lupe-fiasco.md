Wow. I think that just about sums up my feelings on the third single from Food & Liquor II, Lupe&#8217;s next album. The lyricism on this track is what most Lupe fan&#8217;s have been hungering for ever since the first F&L, The Cool, and his mixtapes since then. This track isn&#8217;t just something you can listen to once or twice, to properly digest what Lu is saying I would sit down and listen to this track 7-8 times in a row. Powerful, powerful track, although the production is kind of repetitive and can get a little boring.
