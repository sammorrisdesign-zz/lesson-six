The Good Sin had his breakthrough moment, shared with 10,4 Rog last year, with the _Late EP_. This half an hour EP married a confident stripped-back sound with Sin&#8217;s diverse vocal talents. It really put the pair of them on the map in a burgeoning Seattle Hip-Hop scene. Nearly a full year later, The Good Sin has branched out to other producers (although still works with Rog on a few tracks here) and has just dropped his first full album since that striking release. Unfortunately though, a few minor tweaks to the formula end up biting back, as _The Story of Love x Hate_ rarely gets near that assured sound.

What does seem apparent is that The Good Sin lacked the conviction in his own stalwart vocal talents to sustain an entire album. He&#8217;s probably right, every album needs a bit of variation, but here guest vocals are used on pretty much every hook in the album, and unnecessarily so. Maybe the odd female vocal would have provided more flavour to the album, but it&#8217;s used anything but sparingly. That&#8217;s not to sulley the guest vocalists on this album, they do a good job of providing the R&B quality Sin has always flirted with, however, most of the time they sound corny at best.

They simply provide too much clarity, where there once was abstraction and considering the kind of topics The Good Sin covers this seems like a strange choice. Guest features sing lyrics like &#8220;It&#8217;s like the first time, every time&#8221; & &#8220;girl I want you bad, girl I need you bad&#8221; make no attempt to hide topics and make most tracks come across as bad pop. These aren&#8217;t lyrics that would sound great when rapped, so when soulfully sung out over hooks it just draws attention to them. It&#8217;s something that has carried to Sin&#8217;s flow as well. Here he uses more storytelling to clearly discuss struggle and relationships rather than masking them behind the vail of &#8220;The Crown&#8221;. It might not sound like much but it&#8217;s what elevated his previous work above the standard quasi-R&B independent rabble.

Most of the production on _The Story_ hit on the same chords, but aren&#8217;t given that much room to breathe. There&#8217;s also a noticeable amount of mainstream chart techniques at use here, especially in the otherwise southern hip-hop sounding &#8220;Gimme Your Love&#8221;. Again it&#8217;s important to stress that these are minor tweaks, but they add up quickly.

What you&#8217;re left with is a mediocre album lacking the confidence of his predecessor, albeit with a few solid tracks littered about to remind you of what used to be. Fans of his earlier work will find something here, but otherwise, there are too many minor flaws that would have you wondering what the fuss was all about.
