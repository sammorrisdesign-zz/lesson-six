The more we hear from Brother Ali in 2012, the more I&#8217;m convinced this is going to be the best year for him yet. We&#8217;ve already heard Writers Block off the album,Â Mourning In America and Dreaming In Color. Yet today Rhymesayers released another banger, from an EP that&#8217;s dropping on Monday. The free EP, entitled The Bite Marked Heart, will include seven tracks, one of them being this, &#8220;Shine On&#8221;.

So I guess we&#8217;ll be back on Monday then.
