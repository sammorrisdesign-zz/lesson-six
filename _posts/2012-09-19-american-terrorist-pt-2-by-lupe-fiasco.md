Dubstep! Lupe Fiasco&#8217;s career goes into even stranger territory on the mythical 2nd part of his American Terrorist trilogy of tracks. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a massive fan, Pt. 1 fit nicely on an album that is essentially Lupe&#8217;s _Illmatic_in _Food & Liquor_. This track sums up 2012 Lupe incredibly well though, conflicted and slightly lacking in direction. But if nothing else, &#8220;American Terrorist Pt.2&#8243; has highened my interested in the upcoming _Food & Liquor 2:The Great American Rap AlbumÂ _because now every track we&#8217;ve heard is completely different.
