An interesting phenomena I&#8217;ve noticed when Odd Future, their music and its popularity are being discussed is the comparison drawn between them and the Gravediggaz. Comparisons between contemporary and past musicians is neither new or unique. When attempting to digest a newly popular form of music the listener will attempt to liken it to something familiar to help them understand and categorize it. What is notable about the Odd Future-Gravediggaz parallel is that it is typically used pejoratively by fans of the Gravediggaz, waving off the popularity of Odd Future by linking it stylistically to a group they enjoy. Writing off a current trend by tracing back its stylistic origins to a group considered pioneers of said sub-genre is a non-argument at best, at worst it betrays an ignorance of the very group of which they are purported fans.

The Gravediggaz were formed in 1994, a &#8220;supergroup&#8221; composed of RZA (The Rzarector), Prince Paul (The Undertaker), Frukwan (The Gatekeeper) and Too Poetic (The Grymreeper). At the time, three out of the four members had already established themselves musically: RZA had dropped an EP on Tommy Boy called Ooh I Love You Rakeem and had released Wu Tang Clan&#8217;s 36 Chamber the previoius year; Prince Paul and Frukwan were members of Stetsasonic with three albums released, and Paul had countless production credits under his belt including three De La Soul albums and songs by Big Daddy Kane, 3rd Bass and Boogie Down Productions. The group&#8217;s first album 6 Feet Deep (its original title was [Niggamortis](http://s.dsimg.com/image/R-103388-1090330730.jpg) which it was released in the UK and Europe but changed for the American market to avoid controversy) is considered an influential and pioneering release in the subgenre known as horrorcore.

Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA, or henceforth referred to as Odd Future) were formed in 2007-2008 and are a hip hop collective which comprise Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Domo Genesis, Mike G and Left Brain. Prior to 2008&#8242;s The Odd Future Tape, none of the members had established a name for themselves and were relative unknowns. Their fame can in part be attributed to net-savy and free releases. Their music is considered [by some](http://www.urb.com/2011/03/18/7-degrees-of-horrorcore/) to be horrorcore which the group decries through [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=C7mF85jdN8U#t=227s), [interviews](http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1660136/odd-future-tyler-the-creator-goblin-album.jhtml) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/fucktyler/status/38044570575044608). I will return to the horrorcore genre, but a more apt comparison could be drawn to Anticon whose fame spread beyond the paltry distribution of their physical releases and reached a larger audience through the digital piracy of file sharing sites and software. Both also have similar [DIY](http://d.yimg.com/ec/image/v1/release/20624173) album [artwork](http://tracksnob.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tyler-the-creator-goblin-album-cover-artwork.jpg) sensibilities, and both are collectives. It is worth noting that co-founder and former Anticon member sole has taken up a similar web presence as Odd Future, his webpage a Tumblr, and he may be on Twitter more often than Tyler.

The Gravediggaz sound has its feet firmly cemented in dark, gritty, sample-based NY boom bap production drowning in low-end. Prince Paul produced the majority of the album with RZA credited on 3 tracks, but his fingerprints are all over 6 Feet Deep. Odd Future&#8217;s production is largely handled by Tyler with Hodgy Beats, Left Brain and The Super 3 (or Jet Age of Tomorrow) also contributing.  The Odd Future&#8217;s production, at least Tyler&#8217;s, is lumbering, grimy midi-synth driven lo-fi electronic based hip hop. The song Yonkers is the strongest production link between the two (see: [Defective Trippin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4gQP5r4IyU)), but the rest of his album Goblin might be better compared to production on [Season ov da Siccness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ8q7v305kM) by Brotha Lynch Hung, another California so-called horrorcore rapper. In fact, the Odd Future sound is very much-so a West Coast sound and a song like Bitch Suck Dick wouldn&#8217;t feel out of place on a hyphy compilation. Perhaps a parallel could be considered between Odd Future and RZA and the numerous Wu-Disciple producers like Mathematiks and True Masta, but a heavy Tyler tutelage is not as glaringly obvious on Odd Future&#8217;s stable as RZA&#8217;s was and continues to be in Wu-Tang&#8217;s.

Lyrically, at least delivery-wise, the comparison is night and day. The Gravediggaz rapped in a manic, throaty-growl in the fine tradition of early-to-mid 90&#8242;s East Coast hardcore hip-hop which Wu-Tang, among others, helped usher in. Odd Future&#8217;s emcees rap with the barely-caring cool which is prevalent in contemporary swag rap with a touch of contents-under-pressure repressed aggression. While Tyler&#8217;s gravel-pit tambre could be compared to RZA&#8217;s, in sound and delivery I would offer that [Camu Tao](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=S46a5af53lQ#t=145s) and [Too Poetic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg27teJm4AI) would make for a stronger case. It is the subject matter which could be considered the strongest-yet-weakest thread tying the two together, the one which labels both horrorcore. Horrorcore, for the uninitiated, is rap which focuses on &#8220;horror-influenced topics that can include cannibalism, suicide, murder, and Satanism&#8221; and its sound is appropriately dark. Both group&#8217;s lyrics contain mentions of death, murder, torture and suicide, but it is the frequency of occurrence which makes this comparison more a matter of contrast.

The Gravediggaz are considered influential and pioneers in the genre of horrorcore, but I think that is arguable. The socially-unpalatable subject matter is there, but horror serves rather as a loose theme for what could be considered archetypal of the mid 90&#8242;s dystopian depictions of New York City life. Songs like 1-800-Suicide and 2 Cups of Blood stand out in the case for parentage but examined alongside Ganksta N-I-P&#8217;s South Park Psycho, two years 6 Feet Deep&#8217;s senior, the cracks begin to show. References to the teachings of The Nation of Gods and Earths, a splinter group of the Nation of Islam, and RZA repeating the phrase &#8220;Positive Energy Activates Constant Elevation&#8221; would not be considered characteristically horrorcore subject matter. I would consider Onyx&#8217;s All We Got Iz Us a better example of the New York horrorcore sound. In fact, both All We Got Iz Us and Goblin contain skits depicting a young male begging for his life before being shot.

Odd Future use the subjects more liberally. It should not go without mention that Odd Future&#8217;s frequent references to rape and homophobia can not be traced back to 6 Feet Deep which broached neither subject. Their world view is less peppered with that of a Nation of Islam offshoot than smothered in teenage nihilism. On Goblin, Tyler&#8217;s mentions of suicide are self-referential; on 1-800-Suicide, the Gravediggaz are speaking to an unnamed protagonist. The sociopathic depictions of relationships, violence against women and sexual assault might better be linked to [Eminem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcUgsvpchms). Other parallels between the two could be their split-personality alter egos (Wolf Haley and Slim Shady/Marshall Mathers), their celebrity name-calling and lashing out against critics contrasted with their critical acclaim and popularity. One could point out that neither Odd Future nor the Gravediggaz are being serious, but that is a moot point. It is so general that it could link them nearly every rapper or group in the genre, not to mention a significant portion of all rap music.

So what we are left with is a false premise of a non-argument. The link between Odd Future and Gravediggaz is tenuous and sets a precedent for lazy, non-factual talking points taking the place of well reasoned arguments. I am not a fan of Odd Future&#8217;s music and I don&#8217;t care much for the obsession with Tyler&#8217;s Twitter feed, however, I am less a fan of poor arguments. Odd Future&#8217;s music can and should be critically reviewed on its own merits without dismissing it entirely by linking it to its stylistic forebear as if that is a point against it. I listed several parallels to other artists and groups and they are but a few of the countless which could be drawn. What is the common thread among them? Putting that they&#8217;re all stronger than the Odd Future/Gravediggaz parallel aside, it is the understanding that none of them can be chalked up as a point against Odd Future or given as a reason to dislike them. You can dislike both Odd Future and Eminem because of their frequent rape fantasizing and it would be a reasonable point of contention. To dislike Odd Future because they rap about assault on women which is nothing new because Eminem did it, however, is not, but that is a distinction which seems to be lost on many.
