It&#8217;s not brand new RJD2 but it&#8217;s the closest we&#8217;ve been for awhile. Here&#8217;s the summerjam &#8220;Just Love Me&#8221; from his recently released _The Abandoned Lullaby Instrumentals_. If you recognise the name, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s from his 2011 collaboration with soul singer Aaron Livingston as Icebird.
