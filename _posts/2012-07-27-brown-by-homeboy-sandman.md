Homeboy Sandman has just been going from strength to strength since he signed with Stones Throw roughly a year ago. Not content with the two releases he has put out on the well-respected alternative label, he&#8217;s just shared the abstract sounding &#8220;Brown&#8221;. With intriguing production by Jonti who has created a beat that is, well, beatless. Soft basslines take a background to harmonious vocals and what sounds like a jack-in-the-box without the threat of the pop. It&#8217;s all very nice.
