One Be Lo is back at it again just a few months after his latest release LABOR, which was one of my favorite albums of the last year, this time releasing a new album titled K.I.C.K P.U.S.H. Like all of his other work the title of the album is all in the acronym and this one stands forÂ _Keep it cool kid. People usually show hate._ Before even listening to the album I would recommend that you read what Lo said about the album on the band camp page, which you can find below as well as stream the full album from there. This is a release that may not be as serious as LABOR, which was a very deep album with many layers, so just sit back and listen.
