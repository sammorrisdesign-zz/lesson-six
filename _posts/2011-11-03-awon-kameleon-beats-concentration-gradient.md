Following the success of their Love Supersedes LP, Awon & Kameleon Beats teamed up again to create Concentration Gradient. Concentration Gradient is darker and edgier with Awon continuing to tell powerful stories through song. The soulful jazzy production is a perfect accompaniment to Awon&#8217;s raps.
