I think the thing that scares me the most about all of this is that this is two hours long and has been dubbed &#8220;Round One&#8221;. Some impressive stuff here as Premo &#038; Pete Rock hit a Japanese crowd with a barrage of the classics. Looking forward to the full release for this, will be a must buy.
