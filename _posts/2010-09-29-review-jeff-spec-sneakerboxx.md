June, people. JUNE! And only now am I getting around to listening to _Jeff Spec&#8217;s_ latest album. Although it does correlate well with the North American release of _Sneakerboxx_, which is totally intentional, of course. This is Jeff&#8217;s fifteenth release, dating all the way back to his self published and recorded albums back in the late 90&#8242;s and early 2000&#8242;s.

<!--more-->&#8220;Turn it UP!&#8221; is as close to a perfectly named opening tracks as there ever will be. Bass kicks in, then it all drops down as the vocals come in to a smooth sound. It&#8217;s an anthemic call out to the people of the world. The production of this track really sets the tone for the album. It&#8217;s all perfectly polished and full of great beats, a real live music feel, almost gospel in parts.

There are a few tracks that have really catchy choruses, thanks to the work from _NaRai_. The first being track three,&#8221; Stop&#8221;; it remenisces on the past while others are about the present and the future. You get the feeling that the album speaks about the journey to where he is today; its honest throughout, depressingly so in&#8221; Stranger&#8221;, again featuring _NaRai_.

> It&#8217;s a world of television, you&#8217;re surrounded by stars / Life&#8217;s a gamble, even if you counting the cards / Whether or not I like the sound of the odds / Just the way it is / They don&#8217;t like the little guy, I&#8217;m just trying to make it big

It&#8217;s not all bleak, even when Jeff is at his most political &#8211; like in &#8220;80&#8242;s Baby&#8221; &#8211;  he has your feet tapping and head nodding as his delivery is excellent. &#8220;My Story&#8221; is the newest single of the album and it&#8217;s one of the best. Perfectly fitting with the message of Lesson 6, talking about his emergence and persistence to get into hip-hop, and most importantly it&#8217;s from the heart. The references to previous tracks and the subject, sneakers, is used so well throughout.

It&#8217;s hard to name the best tracks of the album as they all work so well to make the it what it is. The middle section does lose the opening&#8217;s power but it has the fore-mentioned catchyness. &#8220;Microphone Bully&#8221;, featuring _Shane Lee_ &#8211; and it&#8217;s brilliant opening skit &#8211; kicks the album back into this vibe and wholeheartedly throws itself into the gospel theme.

The bonus track is one of my favourites on the album. Why is it a bonus? It should be unashamedly in there at the start. _Jeff Spec_ definitely shines on _Sneakerboxx_, a well produced album that flows from start to finish. Only wish I had got onto this when the sun was shining and I could wear my damned Sneakers.
