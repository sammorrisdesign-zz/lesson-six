Last year a few of us were impressed with what we heard from My Son The Hurricane on their debut EP, Check The Barometer. For anyone who has been following our monthly radar posts where we detail release dates of upcoming albums, the news that their new album is on the way won&#8217;t be much of a surprise.

While April the 5th is the full release date, we&#8217;ve had a little listen and are just as impressed as were last year &#8211; who knew 14-piece rap groups with 8 horn players would sound great?Â Anyway we&#8217;ve got something special for you in a listen to the first single from the album You Can&#8217;t Do This, entitled &#8220;Pushing Up Daises&#8221; featuring guest vocals by Nigel Williams. One we&#8217;re salivating for.
