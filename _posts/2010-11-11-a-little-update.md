Just a little update from Lesson Six HQ.

Last week we had our first &#8216;Report&#8217; on a post and in retrospect we agree. Mac Miller&#8217;s [first track](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/07/kool-aid-frozen-pizza-by-mac-miller/) we featured on here was bordering on the clichéd but the second &#8211; now deleted &#8211; post was very much all the way clichéd. So thanks for keeping us in check. Remember if you see something that is clichéd feel free to let us know with that massive red button and tell us how stupid we&#8217;re being.

The Lesson Six Top Six has been a bit loose as of late with it turning into more of a sporadic affair than the weekly Monday post but we have plans for it, so don&#8217;t threat.

We&#8217;re also looking for compile our second Mixcloud release and will soon be having a vote on what our subject is, so keep an eye out for that. Otherwise that&#8217;s it.

Thanks for your continued support of the site.
