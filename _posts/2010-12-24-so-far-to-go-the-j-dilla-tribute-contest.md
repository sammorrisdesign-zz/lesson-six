Confusing title, I know, but this is an artwork competition where the proceeds go to the J Dilla Foundation, helping fund inner city music programs and scholarships to promising students, and that&#8217;s something that Lesson Six can get behind.

There is some great art on the site but we have put our backing behind [djSonryze](http://twitter.com/#!/djSonryze), who notified us of his art and the competition over Twitter. It really is a beautiful piece of art and you can see the WIP video below as well his little studio that has me very jealous. Click [here](http://art4dilla.com/entry/146) and vote for his piece, or any other piece on the site.
