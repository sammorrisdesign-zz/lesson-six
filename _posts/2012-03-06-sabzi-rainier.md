Been almost three months since Sabzi, one half of Blue Scholars, released his beat tapes from the past years. This one is filled with some more catchy beats and awesome production, which some may recognize from some of the various songs he has produced for the Blue Scholars, Common Market, and many more.

Also, in semi unrelated news, the Blue Scholars announced a short film competition with a prize of 1000$, all you have to do is make a short film pertaining to their album Cinemetropolis, check out more <a href="http://bluescholars.com/cinecontest/" target="_blank">here</a>
