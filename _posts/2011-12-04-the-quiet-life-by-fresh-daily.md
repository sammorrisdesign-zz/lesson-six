Despite not wholly subscribing to our Clich√©-Free ethos for every track, Fresh Daily has a habit of picking out a brilliant beat which makes him hard to resist. It&#8217;s reason why we had a hard time choosing what FD track to put on our [Soundtrack to the Summer 2](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/09/soundtrack-to-the-summer-2/). While we didn&#8217;t pick the title track off his early half of [2011 release](http://freshdaily.bandcamp.com/album/the-quiet-life), The Quiet Life, it was close, and it just got a video. These things have a way of working themselves out.
