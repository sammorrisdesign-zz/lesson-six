About a month ago I managed to pick up a copy of [Frank 151](http://www.frank151.com/), as their 48th issue was all about DOOM. To accompany the book, which is well worth picking up and is great read, Frank has just released a short video with Blake Lethem talking about the origins of the mask. Not only does he detail the mask DOOM wears now but goes into the reasoning behind it and what he did before finding that now iconic mask.
