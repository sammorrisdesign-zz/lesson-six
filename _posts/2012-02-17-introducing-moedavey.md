The first week of February was welcome to one of the best boom-bap downloads we&#8217;ve heard in a long while. [&#8220;Beauty Joints&#8221;](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/download-moedavey-melodious-mikes-beauty-joints/), by MOEdavey and featuring Melodious Mike, focused on different descriptions and meanings behind the word beauty &#8211; it also had great production. So we caught up with the producer half of that release, [another](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/introducing-jae-fresh/)Â British artist, MOEdavey and allowed him to introduce himself by asking him those important six questions.

<!--more-->

## Who?

A hermit crab beat maker.

## Where?

Bristol & Bexhill-On-Sea&#8230; But I represent the fine city of Plymouth.

## When?

I used to MC when I was about 12/13 and continued to do so till i was about 18. I began beat making when i was around the same age (I call it beat making but we&#8217;re are talking about Hiphop EJay) Then I had a long hiatus. I always had ideas (for beats) but I didnt have any idea of how to do it. Then from the age of 20 I started to beat make for &#8216;Real&#8217;.

## What?

Well Me and Melodious Mike just released &#8216;Beauty Joints&#8217; which is my second full lengh project with The Devil&#8217;s Kazoo. I also just re uploaded my first 3 eps with bonus tracks for new listeners called &#8216;Younger Years&#8217;. Plus me, Melodious Mike and Big Rooz have alot of ideas floating about so your going to need to stay posted.

## Why?

Because I love Hip hop culture. Also I&#8217;m sick of these so called &#8216;Hip hop&#8217; artists releasing really shitty pop laiden albums because they want to be part of the mainstream. I&#8217;ve always built upon the original blueprints that the godfathers left.

## How?

Me, my samples, my feelings and sometimes a nice big spliff. I would&#8217;nt like to tell anyone how i do it because everyone does that. Im not going to list drum machines, keyboards, samplers and the such it&#8217;s all about the buzz of making something your happy with. If it&#8217;s hiphop to me believe its going to be some boom bap to you.

_And that wraps up another [Introducing](http://www.lessonsix.com/category/feature/introducing/), as always thanks to MOEdavey for answering our questions.
