  <p>
    I’ll try and stop this one from sounding like an apology but I’m sure I’m not the only one here. I think it all stems from Jurassic 5, as a flurry of great albums where followed up by a shocker. It’s tough to pinpoint what when wrong but Cut Chemist leaving before ‘Feedback’ was released is the closest I’ve been able to rationalise it. Something that was only confirmed when Cut Chemist went on to release great music while Nu-Mark, seemingly, started to fade to obscurity despite Blend Crafters being a return to form. However, recently things got interesting as both Nu-Mark and Cut Chemist decided to release Afro- Caribbean mixes and it’s safe to say that Nu-Mark has topped Cut Chemist and then some with the more expansive and accessible, ‘Take Me With You’. Don’t get me wrong; I don’t hate ‘Sound of the Police’ but while that sounded like a lesson in obscure World, Caribbean & specifically African music, this sounds like an entire education.
