How does one &#8220;blog&#8221; about anything? This is a question (when I was writing this, I accidentally wrote &#8220;questino&#8221; and for a brief, fleeting moment, considered keeping it, with a note to Sam instructing him to keep it as is) which has been posited since time immemorial, or at least as long as web logs have existed.

Since that is a question which is so broad and all-encompassing, how about we narrow it down to &#8220;How does one &#8220;blog&#8221; about &#8220;hip hop&#8221;? Is the Internet not already so flooded with worthless, opinions by certified non-geniuses that it really necessitates me throwing my hat into that proverbial garbage pile? Well, I&#8217;m sitting here writing this thing, and you&#8217;re sitting here reading it, so the answer is apparently &#8220;sure&#8221;.

Now, as this is a website whose motto is &#8220;Cliche-Free Hip Hop&#8221;, it&#8217;s only right that I make a good first impression by dredging the depths of one of the more recent cliches &#8211; the Death of Hip-Hop. Good first topic, right? What better a way to introduce you, the reader, to my bliterary (blog + literary = bliterary. Look it up. It does not exist) stylings than to drone on about something which has been droned-on about more than the Afghanistan-Pakistan border? If you decide to close your web browser and go throw up right now, I understand.

I&#8217;ll keep this short and sweet: I&#8217;ve notice that a favourite (that&#8217;s right &#8211; there&#8217;s a &#8220;u&#8221; in favourite. This is the English that everybody else in the world uses, Americans. Your exceptionalism includes entirely arbitrary changes to accepted grammar, but that&#8217;s it&#8217;s own web log. Also, &#8220;Americans&#8221;? Your country is not called &#8220;America&#8221;, you are the &#8220;United States OF America. America, or rather, the Americas, are continents, and you are the United States which are located on the Northern one. Crack an atlas much?) subject of Tweets and Facebook status updates is bemoaning the death of hip-hop because of a litany of reasons, including, but not exclusive to:

  * A currently popular artist who you do not enjoy
  * You don&#8217;t enjoy what passes for hip hop on the radio
  * They don&#8217;t make hip hop like they used to
  * They don&#8217;t make hip hop like mom used to make it
  * Etc…

First of all, I understand that everybody is entitled to their opinion, but nobody is entitled to their own facts and the fact is: your opinion is not based in fact. It&#8217;s based in personal preference and the only fact is that you don&#8217;t like mainstream hip hop. A lot of you mugs act like your opinion is fact because Drake and Lil Wayne and Wiz Khalifa and Justin Bieber are topping the charts, but let me ask you this: So?

At what point in any form of music was pop versions of said music the barometer or litmus test for the overall quality of the genre? Never in your lifetime, right? To realize how stupid this argument is, go back to 1990, the so-called Golden Age (depending on who you ask) of hip hop, and judge the quality of hip hop of that era on what was charting: MC Hammer&#8217;s U Can&#8217;t Touch This. If one were to apply the critical standard of the contemporary casual hip hop curmudgeon to that time, one would say it has been dead since 1990. Probably since before then, but nobody does that, because doing that would make one sound like an idiot. What I&#8217;m saying is that when you say hip hop is dead and reference some Johnny-come-lately to validate your argument, you look like an idiot.

Do I even need to address the argument which states that because hip hop has moved away from its roots, the emcee, the samples, and the DJ, that it is dead? The sounds we have all come to know as Golden Age Hip Hop (the time period of said Golden Age is debated, but tends to fall between 1987 and 1993) are the product of people working within the limitations of the tools and technology available to them. The tools have evolved and have become vastly more affordable and accessible, thus the sound has evolved and changed. Hip Hop is also no longer geographically centralized to a few key areas, and with the Internet, traditional media outlets no longer serve as taste-makers limiting the exposure of up-and-coming artists. You can yearn for the &#8220;good ol&#8217; days&#8221; and the simplicity of beat making, but aside from a few talented producers, attempts to recreate this sound fail.

> Now, as this is a website whose motto is &#8220;Cliche-Free Hip Hop&#8221;, it&#8217;s only right that I make a good first impression by dredging the depths of one of the more recent cliches.

Yes, people have been droning on about the death of hip hop since the day after hip hop was born, but you know what? History proved them wrong, and history will continue to prove all of you mugs wrong when you criticize the forest for the trees. Perhaps you only liked a specific time period of hip hop, and that&#8217;s fine, Like that specific time period of hip hop, but shut up about hip hop being dead. Nobody cares, and anybody who does care, nobody else cares about what they have to say except for you.

Look, Nas called his album &#8220;Hip Hop Is Dead&#8221; because he&#8217;s been struggling to stay relevant since people stopped caring about the Jay-Z/Nas beef (and I don&#8217;t care what anybody says, Ether sucked. Lyrical content aside, it was unlistenable. Taking lyrical content INTO consideration, it was lazy garbage ie. &#8220;Gay-Z and Cock-A-Fella Records&#8221;), so he&#8217;s been swinging for the fences since then. He put out a double disc album that, yes, did give us Thief&#8217;s Theme, but it still stands that God&#8217;s Son is an unwieldy drink coaster at best, Hip Hop Is Dead gave people a renewed fervour for a topic which we&#8217;ve already established makes them look like an idiot, and the Untitled album&#8217;s original title only made for a half-funny CunninLynguists YouTube commercial.

Your opinion is worthless to anybody but yourself, unless you are an established critic or a taste-maker, which the majority of us are not. Heck, my opinion is worthless but is given an aura of credibility because it&#8217;s here on this website. If it was on a site with .blogspot.com as the domain, it might as well be a cat blog which claims it is written by an actual, honest-to-god cat, which we all know is impossible. But here I am, writing my opinion on other peoples opinions of things, and here you are reading it. What has this world come to?
