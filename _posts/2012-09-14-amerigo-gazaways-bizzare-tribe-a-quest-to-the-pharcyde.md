Two of the best hip-hop acts of all time on one album, who could argue with that. Amerigo Gazaway took Pharcyde vocals and combined them with the original recordings from A Tribe Called Quest&#8217;s catalog. The best explanation comes from the description itself:
  
_Join Gummy Soul&#8217;s Amerigo Gazaway as he embarks on a 55 minute &#8220;Quest to The Pharcyde&#8221;. Utilizing the original Jazz, Soul and Funk recordings sampled throughout A Tribe Called Quest’s extensive catalogue, Gazaway recreates classic productions – pairing his reinterpreted instrumentals with select vocals from West Coast “golden era” favorites, The Pharcyde._
