Alright, this is merely an advert for LMNO&#8217;s bumper pack of albums coming out soon but it&#8217;s not bad. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve listened to many of the releases though, Banger Management was my first I can&#8217;t say I was completely impressed. We&#8217;ll try and review some of the others sometime down the line though.
