    As the late Guru used to profess, “It’s mostly the voice, that get’s you up”, never have those lyrics rung truer. That’s not to say that the MC fronting the impressive-sounding sixteen piece brass band, My Son The Hurricane, ruins their full debut release. However, it’s safe to say that ‘You Can’t Do This’ definitely doesn’t “make you buck”.

    Despite sounding like someone who might sound better off in front of a late-90s American rock/hip-hop crossover band, Jacob Bergsma has definitely something unique going for him. He always manages to split the comments on lessonsix.com, he’s very much a marmite lyricist who sounds like none before him, for better or for worse. While at times it can come off as grating and over-the-top, it’s hard to imagine such a project being fronted by anyone else. Unfortunately where it becomes hard to defend is lyrically. Bergsma’s at his best on the introspective “Life of an Emcee” where he starts to open up and we get to meet someone behind the voice.

      Meanwhile, the majority of the rest of it is brought up to listenable standards by the backing band that are incredibly difficult to hate and do a great job of giving hip-hop something new and interesting to ponder. However, for now that’s the level where My Son The Hurricane will remain; something new and interesting, just waiting for their amazing breakthrough album. SM
