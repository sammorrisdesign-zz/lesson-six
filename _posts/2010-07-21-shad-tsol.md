Despite finally starting to breakthrough the glass ceiling by getting the widespread recognition it always deserved, Canadian Hip Hop is an odd one to call. There&#8217;s no shortage of artists to name, but equally there is no distinct sound that you can label as Canadian. That diverse sound coming from north of the border allows artists to experiment and avoid being pigeon-holed towards a certain sound. Most artists would find that freedom daunting, _Shad_ however, doesn&#8217;t.

<!--more-->The follow up to 2008&#8242;s Polaris nominated, 

_The Old Prince_, starts off were the last one left off. _Shad_ made a habit of idiosyncratically skipping from triumphant and celebratory to reflective and sadness with effortless ease. It&#8217;s something that he tried with _The Old Prince_, it&#8217;s something that he mastered with _TSOL_, albeit with more of the joyous former than _The Old Prince_.

> &#8220;Heard a voice say Hey, you never question when you get the blessing / So don&#8217;t get vexed when your life is stressed / And I promised I&#8217;ll be with you no matter what the issue / But there will be some issues to address/ Listen to the lady in the dress&#8230;&#8221;

That&#8217;s not to say that _TSOL_ is littered with throwaway tracks, in fact the opposite. While the meaning and subject matter is still deep and explored, the production is made much more accessible. On either of his first two albums &#8220;Rose Garden&#8221; would have become a slow thoughtful three minutes, now it&#8217;s a playful and thoughtful three minutes on the highs and lows of life. The same goes for many of the albums stand out tracks. Especially &#8220;Keep Shining&#8221;, where he calls out the genre for a lack of female artists & &#8220;A Good Name&#8221; where he divulges the origin of his name and family. Hip-Hop with meaning is the name of the game and _TSOL_ delivers it in an enjoyable way &#8211; most of the time.

The back end of the album starts to flip moods more frequently with varying degrees of success. Slower tracks like &#8220;Listen&#8221; and &#8220;At The Same Time&#8221; would have suited _The Old Prince_ or even _When This is Over_ perfectly, here they stop the album dead. While _TSOL_ isn&#8217;t afraid to deliver on an energetic party sound that&#8217;s been scarce throughout _Shad&#8217;s_ discography, that sound bookends the two tracks mentioned above, leaving you feeling awkward about the whole thing.

Yet retrospectively, you&#8217;ll realise how brilliant most of it is. While none of _TSOL_ is bad per se, some of it doesn&#8217;t feel at home. Don&#8217;t let that put you off though. When _Shad_ is at his worst, he&#8217;s better than the best of them. The quality, depth and personality shown on _TSOL_ only confirms that.
