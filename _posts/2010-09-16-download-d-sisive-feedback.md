Another free track has been dropped by D-sisive in support of  The Manifesto, which is described as a &#8220;non-profit grassroots organization working to unite, energize, support and celebrate Toronto’s vibrant and diverse music and arts community, and find innovative ways of working together towards common goals&#8221;. Sounds good, right? So does the track.
