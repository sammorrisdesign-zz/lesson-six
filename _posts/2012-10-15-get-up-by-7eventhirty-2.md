I missed the video dropping last week, but its never too late. Since first hearing this drop, I was looking forward to the full album, but this track is easily one of the best. The video fits the eccentric and witty 7evenThirty perfectly. Make sure to get the entire album cause its pretty crazy, in a good way.
