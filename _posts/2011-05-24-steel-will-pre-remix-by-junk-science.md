I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that we post a lot of Junk Science on here. It&#8217;s probably too much but the production and lyrics are just some of the best in contemporaryÂ hip-hop today. I also admit that they&#8217;re a little strange, and probably not to every body&#8217;s taste. Until told otherwise, I&#8217;m just going to presume that everyone agrees with the former.

With that being said, Pre has remixed a track to get your ass out of bed. Modern Shark have just released this beautiful remix of the already great &#8220;Steel Will&#8221;. I tend not to enjoy remixes past the first listen but this has been on repeat for a while now.
