Determined not to make [the last time](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/08/a-night-of-cliche-free-hip-hop/) a one-off, we&#8217;re already back for another night of cliché-free hip-hop in London.

A night of cliché-free hip-hop with critically acclaimed Canadian artist Wordburglar who will be performing at his first ever UK gig. Featuring tracks from his recent album 3rdburglar, an album packed full of his hilarious brand of wordplay and referential lyrics. We&#8217;ll also have London&#8217;s own breakthrough spoken-word poet & hip-hop artist The Ruby Kid, showcasing his unique political & social commentary.

So come join us at The Shoreditch on Shoreditch High Street, London on Monday the 3rd of September for a night of alternative hip-hop. Tickets are available for £5 at the door or [online here](http://lessonsix-efbevent.eventbrite.com/) from 7:30pm. We&#8217;ll see you then!
