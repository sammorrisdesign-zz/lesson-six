With most of the mainstream press focusing on a group of teenagers, it&#8217;s good to know that there are some progressive sounding artists coming through. Let me introduce 17 year old BlaZe from the Bronx, NY who just sent me the results of him getting his hands on a great Nujabes beat. It&#8217;s a little cheesy in parts but it&#8217;s still great to hear from an artist of this age.
