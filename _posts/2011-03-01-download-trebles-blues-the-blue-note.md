Just a quick heads up for Trebles &#038; Blues&#8217; new release &#8220;The Blue Note&#8221; which has just been released on Bandcamp. You can grab it for free but if you&#8217;re feeling in a nice mood through $5 dollars his way for a nice thank you to the man himself. I&#8217;d be curious to read the numbers in a months time, just to see how this still-experimental way of selling music works.
