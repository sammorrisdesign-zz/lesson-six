I&#8217;ve being doing a lot of writing over the past month, and when I write I like some brain massaging music to will me on. It can&#8217;t have any words in it as I&#8217;ll end up sub-consciously inserting verses into my FIFA 11 review, and that just does not work. So here it is, the beautiful bastard child of a day late Top Six and a two day early Instrumental Thursday.

## Deca One &#8211; CLOUD KNOCKIN&#8217;

from Floating World
  
What better track to kick us off than this. Keep your eyes on this young producer as he has talent.
  


## AFTA-1 &#8211; Trust

from F O R M EP (2010)
  
Can&#8217;t remember when I picked this album up but I&#8217;ve been listening to it lately and it&#8217;s really good.
  


## Above The Clouds &#8211; Television

from Cognitive Dissonance
  
If you read my review of KWES&#8217; new album then you will know of my love for Hames Hancock. The thing is, there was no YouTube love for the man so I went and uploaded the video myself. Go [download](http://www.abovethecloudsmusic.com/music/) his free album now as it is an absolute gem.
  


## Paul White &#8211; Ancient Treasure (feat. Guilty Simpson)

I like this guy. He&#8217;s odd and British. Two things that go hand in hand. I originally wanted to play the instrumental version but found this instead. It&#8217;s not as good but it still deserves a spot.
  


## MiNdToUcH &#8211; All BLuEs

from ToNight aT NoON
  
If you follow lesson6 on Twitter (top left) then you will know how much I&#8217;ve been listening to this album. This track is one of two on YouTube and it does not show how good the 20 odd track album is. Get it [here](http://mindtouch.bandcamp.com/) for free and play it on a loop forever it as it is utterly brilliant.
  


## Elaquent &#8211; Mastered System

from Persona
  
Another album that I absolutely adore. And again it has no YouTube video, but I dared not put it up myself as that would be breaking copyright &#8211; that&#8217;s bad, kids. Still, go and buy this guy&#8217;s album as you won&#8217;t be disappointed.
