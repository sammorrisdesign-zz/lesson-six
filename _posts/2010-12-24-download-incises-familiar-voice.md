I had my doubts but this might be a good Christmas after all. Incise, producer of our [6th favourite album](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/12/album-of-the-year-2010-the-top-ten/) of 2010, has released an instrumental album that&#8217;s completely free. It&#8217;s made up of the beats from his 2008 release, [Nobody&#8217;s Story](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/11/download-incises-nobodys-story-lp/) (which is now also free) and the 6th favourite itself, [Daily Methods](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/08/review-incises-daily-methods/).

Coincidentlly, as we&#8217;re compiling our Tracks of The Year list, it includes the instrumentals for [A New Day](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/08/%E2%80%9Ca-new-day%E2%80%9D-by-incise/). As if I needed another excuse to listen to it.

Anyway, get your [free download](http://kitchendip.com/Incise-FamiliarVoices/).
