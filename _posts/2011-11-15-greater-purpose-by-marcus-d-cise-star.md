This is a really great track inspired by the late Nujabes. Marcus D and Cise Star, of Cyne, met up and recorded this track in a relatively small time period over a year ago. They just released this track a few days ago and this is a good placeholder for Marcus D&#8217;s Melancholy Hopeful coming out soon.
