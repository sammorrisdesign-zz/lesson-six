Das Racist return with their second free album in six months. The first was a big success and I&#8217;ve been listening to it this week. I like it &#8211; it&#8217;s fun, which is not something you can say a lot of music. Das Racist have brought in some big names for this release, enlisting superproducers Diplo, Boi-1da, Scoop Deville, Devo Springsteen and Dame Grease as well as collaborations with El-P, Despot, Roc Marciano, Keepaway, Teen Girl Fantasy, Chairlift and Vijay Iyer. Expect a review soon.
