Prometheus Brown, one half of Blue Scholars, recently released quite a few tracks that were previously unreleased and/or features for other artists. I would highly recommend checking out this little tape, as we get solid appearances by Prometheus Brown. Additionally, many of the other artists featured are pretty good. The whole northwest hip-hop scene has been rocking for the last few years, and it is awesome to see so many new artists coming out and being supported by a great local act.
