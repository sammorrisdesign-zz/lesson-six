Earlier in the month Alternative Hip-Hop mainstay Aesop Rock released his first album in nearly five years. Without spoiling our upcoming review of _Skelethon_, his return to solo projects was more than worth the wait. But his long hiatus allow us to forgive those who aren&#8217;t so familiar with the ex-Def Jukie. So we figured for those who want to dig a little into Aesop Rock&#8217;s back-catalogue, we&#8217;d provide Aesop Rock&#8217;s Essential listening.

## Daylight

_From the album Labor Days_



If there was anyone yet to be convinced, Aesop Rock&#8217;s breakout single &#8220;Daylight&#8221; converted anyone left. Blockhead, a frequent producer of Aesop Rock&#8217;s, absolutely hits it out of the park with the production here.

## None Shall Pass (Tor / Sufjan Stevens Remix)

_A remix from Tor&#8217;s Illinoize, original taken from the album None Shall Pass_



Ok so this isn&#8217;t the original, but Tor&#8217;s remix/mash-up with Sufjan Stevens is a beautiful version of Aesop&#8217;s 2007 album _None Shall Pass&#8217;_ title track.

## ZZZ Top

_From the album Skelethon_



The 2nd track we heard off his new album, _Skelethon,_ pretty much confirmed our high expectations for the longly-awaited album. Here Aesop tells three separate stories of different teenagers and their love for their respective genres.

## Big Bang

_From the album Float_



My first experience of Aesop was with his second album, _Float_. &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; immediately followed the attention grabbing Blade Runner sample on &#8220;Commencement at the Obedience Academy&#8221;, and didn&#8217;t fail to disappoint my captured attention with the great hook on this one.

## Battery

_From the album Labor Days_



We&#8217;ll end how we started, another track from the breakout hit _Labor Days._ &#8221;Battery&#8221; probably has Aesop Rock at his wordiest and Blockhead at his most introspective on beat.

_And that&#8217;s our Aesop Rock Essentials. Check out [previous Essentials](http://www.lessonsix.com/category/feature/essentials/), featuring the likes of Ugly Duckling, People Under The Stairs, Shad K, Jurassic 5 & more._
