Nujabes also known as Jun Seba, unfortunately, passed away last year, and today a new posthumous record was released. Nujabes really helped influence and open eyes towards the production scene in Japan. So many of the artists we post about like Bop Alloy have been influenced strongly by Nujabes. Take a listen to this track and buy the album.

Note, right now the album is only available in Japan, but it is available for import though the price is a bit higher. You can purchase the album overÂ [here](http://www.yesasia.com/global/spiritual-state-japan-version/1025091115-0-0-0-en/info.html)
