This time last year we had to extend our 2010 tracks of the year just to give everyone credit for a great year in music. It turns out, that 2011 was no slouch either and over the next week on the site, we&#8217;ll hopefully prove that with more tracks in our recap of 2011 in Cliché-Free Hip-Hop. So with that being said, here&#8217;s numbers 50 to 41 in our tracks of the year countdown.

## 50. &#8220;This Shit&#8221; by Sol

Sol is just one of the many artists bursting on to the scene from Seattle. This track from Dear Friends, Vol III, is one that has a very summery feel. Great track to lay back and relax to.



## 49. &#8220;Don&#8217;t Need&#8221; by Wax

To say that 2011 for Wax was a good year would be an understatement. His well-recieved mixtaped, Scrublife, led to him getting a record deal with Def Jam, with who, he released his first full album on last month. While this might have been one of a handful of less-cliché ridden tracks off that mixtape, it wasn&#8217;t the only one we had on repeat during March.



## 48. &#8220;Touch The Sky&#8221; by The 49ers

The 49ers teamed up with the production team ZDW!? for the release Soulstice. This track contains the type of music the 49ers do best, with a very jazzy production and another great track to relax too.



## 47. &#8220;Stay Fresh&#8221; by J. Rocc

The only crime J. Rocc commits on his debut solo effort for Stonesthrow, is that Stay Fresh is under two minutes.



## 46. &#8220;City Lights&#8221; by Nujabes

This track from Nujabes post-humous album Spiritual State features his close friends Pase Rock and Substantial. Nujabes was and still is one of the best producers to come out of Japan, and this track and the whole album pay great tribute to him and the whole scene in Japan.



## 45. &#8220;Rooftop&#8221; by Artofficial

We&#8217;ll always have time to listen to live bands on Lesson Six, and Artofficial were no exception. Their new album, _Vitamins & Minerals_, was definitely a crystallising release where it all seemed to come together for the Miami-based group, this track being one of the highlights.



## 44. &#8220;Ready To Fly&#8221; by Audible Mainframe

As was previously mentioned, live bands are a big part of what we listen to here. Audible Mainframe, this past year worked on a remix album of Transients, while facing some hardships with their lead member, Exposition, having been diagnosed with cancer. This track was made during their difficult period and is one of their best singular tracks.



## 43. &#8220;Wings&#8221; by Macklemore

There&#8217;s not really much to say about Seattle&#8217;s Macklemore & Ryan Lewis that hasn&#8217;t already. While we didn&#8217;t get that album, we&#8217;ve been waiting for, they definitely delivered their fair share of top notch audiovisual cinema.



## 42. &#8220;Neon Signs&#8221; by Mr. J Medeiros

This was the first single off of Mr. J Medeiros&#8217;s album Saudade. The album represented a different direction than his previous work, but Neon Signs is the kind of track that Mr. J Medeiros does best as he pulls you in with the emotion that he feels.



## 41. &#8220;Skronk&#8221; by Moka Only

The prolific Canadian rapper, Moka Only, didn&#8217;t slow down during 2011, as you would expect. But when the resident weirdo produces tracks like this, it&#8217;s tough to argue.



_We&#8217;ll be back with more tracks tomorrow&#8230;_
