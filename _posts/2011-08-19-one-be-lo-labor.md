The long awaited album Labor by One Be Lo finally has a release date 8/6/11. One Be Lo has been very quiet over the past couple years until this summer. First we got the Laborhood part 1 mix tape, and now today a release date of the actual album and the first single from the album &#8220;The G.O.A.T.&#8221; Ever since I heard One Be Lo first on Binary Star&#8217;s Masters of the Universe I have been hooked and since then have listened to his other albums including S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. I&#8217;m really looking forward to hearing Labor now that we have a confirmed release date.
