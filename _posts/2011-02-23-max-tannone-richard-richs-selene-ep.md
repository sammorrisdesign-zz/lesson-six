I&#8217;m really having a hard time trying to write something to introduce this post. To say that I enjoyed Moon and it&#8217;s soundtrack would be an understatement. Clint Mansell&#8217;s score for Moon was so fitting for a well-produced and well-written film that didn&#8217;t focus on action despite being a genre that overly relies on action.

Anyway that&#8217;s enough love for Clint Mansell & Moon because, as much as I&#8217;d like it to be right now, this isn&#8217;t a film blog. It seems I wasn&#8217;t the only one who loved the sounds coming out of that film as Producer/DJ extraordinaire, Max Tannone, has sampled the hell out of that soundtrack. Then put Richard Rich on the mic and you&#8217;ve got yourself a promising project. Give it a listen and then download from the [project&#8217;s site](http://www.seleneproject.com/).
