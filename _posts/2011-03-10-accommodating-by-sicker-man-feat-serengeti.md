Originally, this was meant to be a one-off as part of Sicker Man&#8217;s recently released album but thankfully this is progressing in a full project between the two called Shtaad, due for Spring 2011. Looking forward to seeing another side to Serengeti on this one, he&#8217;s basically half singing. We won&#8217;t hesitate on any more details on shtaad between now and then.
