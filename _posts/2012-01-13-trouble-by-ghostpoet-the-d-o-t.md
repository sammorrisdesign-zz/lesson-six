We&#8217;ve known for a few months that Mike Skinner is branching out of hip-hop, if you could have called it that, and into something more poppy. The D.O.T. is the duo of Skinner and frequent collaborator Rob Harvey. Unfortunately, and I only say that after listening to this track, it doesn&#8217;t permanently include Ghostpoet. Hearing Ghost with more of dance inspired upbeat production is kind of interesting. Here&#8217;s the live recorded video for &#8220;Trouble&#8221;.
