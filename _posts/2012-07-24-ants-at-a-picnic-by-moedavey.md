This is off the recently released _Younger Years The EPs_, the Devils Kazoo producer starts it off well with &#8220;Ants at a Picnic&#8221; &#8211; a short KPM Big Beat sounding instrumental with nice and bouncy drums.Â It&#8217;s just one of twenty-eight old instrumentals on the album that deserve a listen if you&#8217;re a fan of boom-bap hip-hop. If you&#8217;re still not convinced, learn more about MOEdavey in [an interview](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/introducing-moedavey/) we conducted earlier in the year.
