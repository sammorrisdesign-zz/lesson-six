Been listening to Incise&#8217;s album Daily Methods recently and without spoiling too much of the forthcoming review, it&#8217;s pretty damn good. Really good summer music that I wish I discovered when it was actually warm. Anyway here is &#8220;A New Day&#8221; by producer extraordinaire, Incise featuring Ajaxx.
