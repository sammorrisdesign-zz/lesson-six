Proving that hip-hop is truly international, here&#8217;s a great track with a laid-back jazzy vibe by Danish Hip-Hop group, Point Blank. This well shot video sees the band from Denmark assemble a treehouse over their latest track &#8220;Welcome&#8221;. The production blows it out the park here. I&#8217;ll be honest and admit to not knowing much about Danish Hip-Hop but I&#8217;m starting to think I should have a little dig. [Download the track for free](http://pointblankdk.bandcamp.com/track/welcome) on their Bandcamp.
