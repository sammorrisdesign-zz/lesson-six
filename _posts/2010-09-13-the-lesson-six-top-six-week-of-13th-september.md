Sam took the Top six towards new exciting territories last week by giving it a theme. I was planning to do the same but last week happened and it was full of hospital trips, doctors, stress, and thankfully, recovery. So with that in mind, this weeks top six are based around tracks that help me relax. Some new, some old.

Enjoy.

## Gang Starr &#8211; Moment of Truth

I&#8217;ve listened to this track far too much in the last week after I uncovered it for an up and coming feature. Stay tuned.



## P.O.S &#8211; Optimist

Intelligent beats, intelligent rhymes, all full of the individual style that P.O.S brings. A great chill track that&#8217;s been perfect for a stressful week.



## People Under The Stairs &#8211; Acid Raindrops

Although there was no &#8220;maryjane&#8221;, I followed the PUTS&#8217; lessons and relaxed this weekend.



## D-sisive &#8211; I Love a Girl

I honestly think this is one of the best love songs I&#8217;ve ever heard. Less pap, more humour and tons of charm. It perfectly fits this weeks Top six.



## SHAD &#8211; I Get Down

I&#8217;ve been trying to plough through SHAD&#8217;s back catalogue recently but have spent too long listening to this track. There&#8217;s so much good hip-hop coming from Canada.



## Supa Unkown &#8211; Mellow Pro

We have an interview/feature/review with DJ ADAMNT coming this week. If you find this album, listen to it and love it, because it&#8217;s damn good.
