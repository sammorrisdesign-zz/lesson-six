Oddisee has been busy lately, with an EP dropping next week, titled Odd Renditions. The EP features a few remixes and edits like the one above. And its not too long till we get to hear Oddisee&#8217;s full length album which drops in June titled People Hear What They See. This song in particular is one of the best remixes I have ever heard. First of all you can&#8217;t really go wrong with Marvin Gaye, and then some solid production by Oddisee as well? I&#8217;m sold.
