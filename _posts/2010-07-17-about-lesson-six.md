Lesson Six is a collective of writers, bloggers and music lovers that have become disillusioned with what mainstream rap has become. We believe that great hip hop is still out there, we share it with you every single week. While we don&#8217;t label ourselves as underground or indie, we do have some strict perimeters. While I could spend all day coming up with a line that describes our manifesto, Scroobius Pip has already done it better&#8230;

> &#8220;Guns, bitches & bling were never part of the four elements and never will be&#8221;

We believe that if we stick to avoiding those three things, we can help reinstate the love of hip hop in those who have become similarly disillusioned. We call this, **Clich√©-Free Hip-Hop.** If you think we&#8217;re straying away from this message, you can hit the red report button on the article and we&#8217;ll take another look.
