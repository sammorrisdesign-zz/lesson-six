Regular readers will know of Lesson Six&#8217;s love of the Canadian scene right now as there&#8217;s so much good stuff coming from a select group of prolific artists. This video shares a bit of history while showcasing some of the new talent. The best part is at the end when artists like _Shad, D-sisive, Muneshine_ and _Buck 65_ share some of their work in a laid back fashion. Shame Abdominal wasn&#8217;t there too, as not only is he a Canuck but his album features on the cover montage.
