We rated them quite highly in our Best of 2010 awards but for the past eleven months we haven&#8217;t heard much since the group&#8217;s first album, City of Dirt. The good news is, not only are they still dedicated to making music, but they&#8217;ve got a self-titled follow-up on the way. &#8220;Mornin&#8217; Paper&#8221;, a collaboration with Addiquit is the first single from said album and gives a little insight into a slightly different sound. One to look forward to for sure.
