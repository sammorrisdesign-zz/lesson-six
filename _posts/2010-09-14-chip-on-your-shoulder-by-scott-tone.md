I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m surprised that this video is odd. Actually I think Modern Shark is going to become a very weird label, if it hasn&#8217;t already. I&#8217;m up for that though, the last Junk Science release was great. Here&#8217;s Scott Thorough & Tone Tank (of Iller Than Theirs) on &#8220;Chip on your Shoulder&#8221; a track from their new album Scott & Tone.
