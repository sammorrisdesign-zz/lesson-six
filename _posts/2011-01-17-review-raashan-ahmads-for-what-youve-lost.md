&#8220;Imagine painting a mural but only using one can&#8221; is _Raashan Ahmad&#8217;s_ response to being labeled & pigeonholed by the media. It actually perfectly sums up the amalgamation that is the follow up to 2008&#8242;s _The Push_. This mixture of styles (or lack of direction, if you&#8217;re feeling critical) might mean that _For What You&#8217;ve Lost_ isn&#8217;t the most concise or solid release you&#8217;re likely to have heard over the last 12 months. But you&#8217;ll constantly be kept on your toes and the album slowly becomes genuinely enjoyable when it gets into its soft Bay Area jazzy-sounding flow.

That is to say _Raashan Ahmad_ gets most of its cheese out the way pretty early. The top-notch soulful production combined with feel good lyrics occasionally mean it can sound slightly corny. It&#8217;s a very difficult area to tread without dabbling in a little cringe-worthy lyricism and _Raashan_ definitely isn&#8217;t the first to fall to this hurdle. Luckily most of it&#8217;s out of the way early with tracks like &#8220;The Feel Good&#8221; & &#8220;In Love With Wax&#8221;.

When it really gets started _For What You&#8217;ve Lost_ oozes laid-back beats and capable lyrics, a great advertisement for the genre. Standout tracks like &#8220;Hey Now&#8221;, &#8220;My Imagination&#8221; & &#8220;Understanding&#8221; really make their mark on the album and stamp home that Bay Area sound. Even the album&#8217;s first single &#8220;Beautiful Ugly&#8221; sounds like some early _Kero One_ being perfected.

> &#8220;I will provide & I ain&#8217;t been thirsty since / Sometimes so tense under false pretense / Been wrong, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m signing my songs about love&#8221;

And while _Kero_ doesn&#8217;t show up himself, just about everyone else does. A wide range of guest appearances from the likes of _Gift of Gab (Blackalicious) & Aloe Blacc_ to the unknown. The problems start to creep in when you apply the law of averages. With so many different artists involved at least a few of them have to be off when writing or recording. Again, it&#8217;s not a problem unique to this release, it&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s plagued a few albums as of late.

However, and it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve been able to fully quantify, but the album is filled with unmemorable lyricism. It&#8217;s weird because the subject matter is pretty clearly defined but this was one that struggled to leave me with a quote. There is little catchy about the entire 45 minutes past the production. I guess this only serves to highlight the consistently great sounding beats that make _For What You&#8217;ve Lost_ such an enjoyable album to listen to.

All of these little issues combine to produce a very mixed album, however, the high points are definitely worth a few skippable tracks here and there. It&#8217;s the very nature of _Raashan Ahmad&#8217;s_ variation in themes and style.

Can you label it though? Well the real question is why should we? We have the tendency to label everything and it occasionally puts artists into pigeonholes from which they never escape. He might not be the first artist to mix it up this much and he definitely won&#8217;t be the last. But what _Raashan Ahmad_ has created with _For What You&#8217;ve Lost_ is a celebration in diversificiation and the result sounds brilliant.
