When the Essentials feature came up while brainstorming regular columns for the site, my kind immediately jumped to the trio from California. What we wanted to do with this site is restore people&#8217;s faith in hip hop music. I couldn&#8217;t tell you how I stumbled upon Ugly Duckling&#8217;s work but I can undoubtedly say that without it my faith wouldn&#8217;t have culminated in this very website. So with that said it would be criminal to not have an Essentials about them.

## Turn It Up

_From the album, Taste The Secret_



It&#8217;s probably fitting that our first choice is Turn It Up. It just epitomises what Ugly Duckling are all about &#8211; Goofy lyrics over brilliantly joyous samples made for parties. I should probably mention that the video is actually a fan-made one, pretty impressive.

## Falling Again

_From the album, Audacity_



However, don&#8217;t let that track make you think Ugly Duckling are just about having a good time. While that might be the point of most of their albums, the last album, Audacity explored a lot more than you usually find in this genre. Yet the samples and clever lyrics made it a level above most conscious thoughtful albums.

## Eye on The Gold Chain (Cut Chemist Remix)

_Originally from the album, Journey To Anywhere_



Ugly Duckling fight the fight that we&#8217;re fighting at Lesson Six. That includes mocking the clich√©s and Eye on The Gold Chain is a good example of that.

## Smack

_From the album, Bang For The Buck_



Still not convinced? Well if Lesson Six had to have a theme (apart from Jurassic 5&#8242;s Lesson Six) this would be it. An excellent video for Smack, what Ugly Duckling really think about &#8220;That gangster pop ringtone crap&#8221;.

## Celebrity

_From the album, The Leftovers_



I&#8217;ll leave you with a rarer track from the bonus Leftovers EP that came with some editions of Taste The Secret. That way you can pretend you&#8217;ve been a big fan for years. Unless you already are, then well done. If not, what are you waiting for?
