Thomas Prime dropped a new EP last week, and it is pretty awesome. The production style hasn&#8217;t changed much from his previous work, but that isn&#8217;t a bad thing. I really love the features on this EP especially Awon on So Much Pain, and Landon Wordswell on Forget Everything. You can download the EP for free <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?z63a223uth61dyh" target="_blank">here</a> or get it on bandcamp through the pay what you want option.
