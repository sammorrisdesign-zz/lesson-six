A free compilation from _Uncommon Records_ themed around money and the worlds desire for more free music. It&#8217;s kind of ironic that they artists are rhyming about getting payed and the state of the industry on a free album but it does work. It&#8217;s often humorous, always honest, and sometimes a bit angry. I don&#8217;t like every track but who does on a compilation? Worth a listen for sure, especially the little skit-cover of _Pink Floyd&#8217;s_ &#8220;Money&#8221;. Hit the jump for more.
