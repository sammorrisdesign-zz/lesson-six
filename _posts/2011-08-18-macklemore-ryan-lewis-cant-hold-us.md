Wings, the first single from the upcoming album by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis made news around the hip hop world with the impressive video about sneakers. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis team up with Ray Dalton on the second single of the upcoming album. A very upbeat single with fast paced production from Ryan Lewis, double time raps from Macklemore and a catchy hook by Ray Dalton. This just makes me want to here the full album more.
