Brown Bag All Stars&#8217; Soul Khan has just released his latest EP, Wellstone, for free on [DJBooth](http://www.djbooth.net/index/mixtapes/entry/soul-khan-wellstone-ep/). The undeniably New York, rapper throws out references and political commentary at an unrelenting pace, not to disimilar to Pharaohe Monch. One I&#8217;ve had on repeat for the last few hours, definitely a freebee you don&#8217;t want to pass on.
