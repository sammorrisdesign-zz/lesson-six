It&#8217;s funny how one line can trigger a playlist:

> &#8220;We should rap about things that we like / Like food?&#8221;

This came about by accident when I was gorging myself on food and a few beers one night and listening to some _PUTS_. It occurred to me that hip-hop is one of the few genres of music where artists can do just that, rap about any subject as long as the content is clever and/or amusing and the beats are good.

## People Under The Stairs &#8211; Eat Street

Below you&#8217;ll find a nice instrumental version and a snippet from a live version. You could try and play the two at the same time, of course. Good luck with that, because I&#8217;m not trying it!
  


## Abdominal and DJ Fase &#8211; Fast Food (Remix by DJ Format)

I&#8217;ve been listening to far too much _Format_ _and _Abdominal_ lately, they&#8217;re such a dream pairing and I for one can&#8217;t wait for their next collaborative effort.

## MF Doom &#8211; Potholderz

How could you have a list about food and not have a track from _Mmm..Food_?
  


## Bully Blinders &#8211; Truck Stop Food

Check out Sam&#8217;s review of this album [here](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/09/review-bully-blinders-city-of-dirt/). I&#8217;ve just go onto it this week and it&#8217;s as good as he says.
  


## Murs and 9th Wonder &#8211; Cigarettes and Liquor

This is an insanely clever song with such a good hook, can&#8217;t stop laughing at &#8220;You call yourself a grown man? You&#8217;re one step away from a twelve step program&#8221;.
  


## Thes One &#8211; Grain Belt Beer

It&#8217;s been a few weeks since I&#8217;ve talked about _Lifestyle Marketing_ so surely I can do it again, right? A nice smooth track to wash away the playlist.
