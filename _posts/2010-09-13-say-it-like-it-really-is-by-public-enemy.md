You know _Public Enemy_ are one of the few artists from back in the day not to have succumbed to the allure of money-making rap. Here&#8217;s a new video for their banger &#8220;Say It Like It Really Is&#8221;. From a special release filled with classics, videos, documentaries and more called _Bring The Noise, Hits, Vids and Doc Box: Greatest Sites & Sounds (Chapter 2 1999-2009)_.
