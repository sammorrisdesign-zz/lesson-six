Sabzi, the producer half of Blue Scholars has decided to release most of his work from past years. These releases are all instrumentals with the first set being the production bedrock for the Blue Scholars first album Bayani. Everyday a new set will be released, and this post will be updated likewise. You can download all of these for free or pay as much as you want.
