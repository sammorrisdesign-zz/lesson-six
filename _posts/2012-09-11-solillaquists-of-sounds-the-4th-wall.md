The Solillaquists of Sound came up on my radar a few years back, but I never really kept tabs on their releases asides from No More Heroes which came out back in &#8217;09. Solilla though were busy at work and came out with an album titled The 4th Wall earlier this year. Great album, and glad I checked back to see what was up with the group.
