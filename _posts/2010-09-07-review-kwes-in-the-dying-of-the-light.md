I’m in love with lesson6 right now. If it wasn’t for this site and it’s ever growing Twitter account then I would not have found out about _KWES_ and his EP, _Against The Dying of the Light_. But the site is not just for sharing new music with us, it’s about letting you hear it. We have to do the work and spread the good tunes for you.

<!--more-->Giving all the love to 

_KWES_, the emcee from Ottowa would be wrong, as the production by _James Hancock_ goes a long way to make the EP what it is. Each track takes the sound somewhere different but keeps the seven songs feeling like a complete package.

Guitars, horns, keyboards, there really is a bit of everything. _KWES’_ lyrical content is the same, verging from fun to deep and political, all the while maintaining a great, catchy flow full of interesting comparisons and ideas.

> Next time you climb a mountain don’t start with the summit / And what you got from it, just a lot of lumps form the fall from it / &#8230;Do your own damn thing, don’t give a hell what they say / I’ve got a parachute pants for my elephant legs

“Pelican Gospel” lays down funky guitars, “Rumpus” shines with old school sounds and big band beats, and “Parachute Pants” even has a banjo. It&#8217;s easily my stand-out track, opening up with a bleak drone and a laid back drum beat before _KWES_ &#8211; sounding a little like _MF Doom_ in parts &#8211; just straight shows off with some technical emceeing; it seems to be about music, life, war, whatever you want to take from it.

The title and closing track take things fully into anti-war territory with an opening sound-clip from an anti-war speech. It’s powerful and hard-hitting, something that _KWES_ obviously feels stongly about.

It’s the perfect marriage between MC and producer, bringing out the best in each others abilities and crafting something which has to be listened to. And it’s even free, so there’s no excuses.
