We haven&#8217;t heard anything from Dilated Peoples in nearly five years now but since The Release Party, we&#8217;ve heard some bangers by way of Rakaa, DJ Babu & Evidence. The latter,who is about to release his first album on Rhymesayers, titled Cats & Dogs. Despite being a pretty accomplished producer himself, he&#8217;s not afraid to call in theÂ artillery with DJ Babu, The Alchemist & DJ Premier who cooked up the Gang-Starr throw-back beat for &#8220;You&#8221;.
