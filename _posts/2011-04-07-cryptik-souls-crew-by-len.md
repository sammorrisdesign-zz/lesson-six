Some strange people might remember Len from their hit-track &#8220;Steal My Sunshine&#8221; from 1999 but they also did this track featuring a ton of young Canadian, then, up and comers. According to discogs the plethora of upstarts where Andy Bernstein (Abdominal), Asicks, C-Plus, Circle Research, D-Sisive, Dane Goulet, Daniel Denton, Dave Yan, DJ Moves, Fraser Wendt, Gordski, Governor Bolts, Insight One, Ishkan, Justin Levy, Phatt Al, Philip Rae, Richard Terfry, S-Luv, Sixtoo, Tachichi. Why anyone would think of putting this many people on one track, I don&#8217;t know but the result is great and quite important for a few of the stars of contemporary Canadian hip-hop.
