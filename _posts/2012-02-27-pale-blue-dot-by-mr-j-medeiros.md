Pale Blue Dot is the first single off of Mr. J Medeiros&#8217;s upcoming EP titled the Pale Blue Dot. This song is just another step in the evolution of Mr. J Medeiros&#8217;s music and it sounds fantastic. You can download the single over <a href="http://mrjmedeiros.bandcamp.com/album/pale-blue-dot-ep" target="_blank">here</a>, which also comes with a few other songs released before. Also you can support our friends over at The Find Mag and Mr. J Medeiros by buying a vinyl with the song and a remix with a guest verse from Shad over <a href="http://thefindmag.bandcamp.com/album/pale-blue-dot-limited-edition-blue-vinyl" target="_blank">here</a>.
