Key points to take from this. One, a new Kero One album is coming out in the summer. Two, first track is called &#8220;What Am I Supposed To Do?&#8221; and is pretty damn good. Three, 50% of the proceeds from [this single](http://keroone.bandcamp.com/track/what-am-i-supposed-to-do) go to the charity, [Free The Slaves](www.freetheslaves.net).
