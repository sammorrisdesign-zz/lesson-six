This is the first _Pigeon John_ record not to have an over-the-top enjoyable piece of cover art to accompany its release. That should probably be enough of a warning, some stuff is stepping on new territory. That&#8217;s not to say _Dragon Slayer_ is full of subdued and laid back autobiographical tracks, but the good parts are.

<!--more-->In fact the opening two numbers are exactly what we&#8217;ve come to expect from one of the most poppy-ist, in a good way, men in hip-hop. &#8220;The Bomb&#8221; and &#8220;Buttersoft Seats&#8221; are full of energy &#8211; it&#8217;s what 

_Pigeon John_ does well.

His unique brand of rock infused hip-hop works well with the likeable personality he presents and _Dragon Slayer_ definitely delivers in that sense. &#8220;Hey You&#8221; and &#8220;Ben Vereen&#8221; carries on that idea towards the back end of the album, as well, and why not? It&#8217;s working better than ever.

> With all the girls and all the drugs, I was a rap cliché / I was convinced I&#8217;d never be one, would have sworn on my grave / I never stooped that low until it was in front of my face

However, no matter how well perfected that formula is, it&#8217;s essentially still playing around with the same ideas &#8211; even if conceptually, they differ. It&#8217;s tracks like &#8220;Davey Rockit&#8221; and &#8220;Before We&#8217;re Gone&#8221; offer a different light on _Pigeon John_ and it&#8217;s great to hear. The autobiographical &#8220;Rock Bottom Again&#8221; is particularly a highlight as _John_ tells the tale of clichéd mistakes he never thought he would make when he got into the game. At times, _Dragon Slayer_ is pretty much the reason why we set up Lesson Six. At other times, however, it&#8217;s like &#8220;So Gangster&#8221; which although isn&#8217;t cliché-fodder like the name might suggest, it is pretty embarrassing.

Dragon Slayer has enough about it for it to be worthwhile for just about anyone to give ago. While it isn&#8217;t the most consistent album, it&#8217;s easily the most accessible and conceptually sound Pigeon John album I&#8217;ve heard and that fact alone is saying alot. It&#8217;s definitely worth checking out for fans of the non-clichéd because the highlights are almost as good as it gets.
