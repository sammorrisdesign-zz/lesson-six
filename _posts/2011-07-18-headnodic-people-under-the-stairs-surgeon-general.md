Not only does Headnodic have the ability to come up with a great pseudonym but he can also produce a fairly decent beat. Here Lesson Six favourite, _People Under The Stairs_ take to four minutes off _Headnodic&#8217;s_ soon to be released album, _Red Line Radio_. While it doesn&#8217;t (as far as I can tell) have any relation to [Redline Racer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEwC6cN6AXM) its set to feature _Raashan Ahmad, Moe Pope, M.r Life, Gift of Gab_ and more. The date you should be writing down is the 26th of July.
