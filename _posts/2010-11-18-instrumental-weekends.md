We normally reserve our instrumental content for Thursdays but after a brief little chat, we&#8217;ve decided that we should do this at the weekends. We usually take the weekends off when it comes to Lesson Six and when we find nothing instrumental that&#8217;s floating boats, we have a gap in the week. A gap that is usually followed by a flood of content on the Friday.

So we&#8217;re pushing the instrumental specific days to the weekends. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll be ignoring instrumentals by pushing them to days that we don&#8217;t focus on. In fact, I might as well announce now that we&#8217;re working on our next mixcloud release, a release solely focus on instrumental hip-hop.
