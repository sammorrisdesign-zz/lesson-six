This year Mello Music Group has been pumping out some amazing music, with albums from Apollo Brown & O.C, Oddisee, one from Substantial coming up, and then 7evenThirty who will be releasing his album Heaven&#8217;s Computer later this year as well. This is the first single from the album and it features a futuristic sound with some dope lyrical content. Looking forward to this one.
