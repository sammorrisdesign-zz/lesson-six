Sometimes it’s fine to have some hip-hop ass hip-hop. Introducing, Rockland County rapper, Kuhlamity’s new release “Word of the Wise” Here Kuhlam absolutely destroys this smooth 9th Wonder beat with his seamless transitions between single and double time rapping. Fairly impressive flow on this one. Off a soon to be released album with Jonathan Lowell.
