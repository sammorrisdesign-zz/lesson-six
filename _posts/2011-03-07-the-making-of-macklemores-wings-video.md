While we were about a year too late on Macklemore &#038; Ryan Lewis&#8217; great [Vs. EP](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/01/the-end-by-macklemore-ryan-lewis/), we&#8217;re staying ahead of it now with making of videos for videos that aren&#8217;t even out yet. This is another snippet from the fan funded video for &#8220;Wings&#8221; taken from Macklemore&#8217;s upcoming project.
