We&#8217;re still awaiting more information on a full release by The Funk League after hearing promising tracks featuringÂ [Andy Cooper of Ugly Duckling](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/08/youre-going-to-learn-by-the-funk-league-andy-c/) & [Speech Defect](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/11/why-you-by-the-funk-league/). However, before we get news on that hotly anticipated release, we&#8217;ve got a 70 minute mix of funk hits, rarities & remixes called My Favourite Thing, on the way. The kind folks of The Funk League have given us a little preview before the full release on the 21st of March in the first 10% of it.
