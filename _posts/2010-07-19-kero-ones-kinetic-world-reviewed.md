We&#8217;ve seen it happen many times before. An unknown artist comes out of nowhere, drops an excellent album and spends the rest of their career trying to emulate it. While _Kero One&#8217;s_ _Early Believers_ wasn&#8217;t awful by any stretch of imagination, it didn&#8217;t come close his first outing on _Windmills of the Soul_. Unfortunately Kero&#8217;s third album, _Kinetic World_, feels equally as lost in an attempt to reclaim that initial sound and ultimately suffers for it.

<!--more-->

_Kinetic World_ eerily runs parallel to _Kero One&#8217;s_ entire career so far, it&#8217;s quite a journey. It wastes little time defining what he stands for in the opening track, &#8220;Let Me Clarify&#8221;. It feels like a manifesto on his love of music set to a laid-back pianos and light scratches. Here, you start to believe the hype.

Once you&#8217;re sitting comfortably, you&#8217;re blasted by the most triumphant set of trumpets you&#8217;ll hear this year. The album&#8217;s title track is purely quality production mixed with a decent guest showing by _Fashawn_. Here, you&#8217;re joining the bandwagon. &#8220;On Bended Knee&#8221; is a slightly corny love song but it&#8217;s hard to be mad at something this chilled out, something this well produced. Now you&#8217;re driving the bandwagon.

Then it hits you.

It came out of nowhere. Pop music at its worst in &#8220;My Devotion&#8221;. It kills the mood that was so excellently set with the opening three tracks. Take the headache-inducing laser noises, that litter the background, as a warning. While Kero One can serve up quality chilled out music, he can also go all schizo on you.

> They say K you&#8217;re kind of soft, you rap too positive / While kids turn killers, wondering what role model is / For all these whack rappers, I&#8217;m not tolerant / I keep my feet firm in my beliefs, others wobbling.

You&#8217;ll feel betrayed. That is until he flips back to chilled on &#8220;Missing You&#8221;, _Kero One&#8217;s_ version of _Atmosphere&#8217;s_ &#8220;Yesterday&#8221;. The excellently delivered narrative is easily where the album peaks, unfortunately, it&#8217;s also where the album stops. The rest continues to flip between well produced relaxed beats and synth-heavy offerings that miss the mark completely. It&#8217;s like he wants to stay true to his San Francisco roots with the chilled out tracks while also wanting to explore something new. The fact that Kero One has produced the entire album himself is surprising considering the lack of a clear direction. When I said this album takes you on a journey, I didn&#8217;t mean in a good way.

It&#8217;s all epitomised on &#8220;Asian Kids&#8221;. _Kero One, Myk, Tablo_ and _Dumbfoundead_ combine to form a tantalising line-up of talent. Unfortunately you caught _Kero_ in the wrong mood. What could have been one of the tracks of the year becomes throwaway &#8211; ultimately, that&#8217;s what the whole album feels like.

_Kinetic World_ is definitely the result of an artist at the crossroads in his career. Stuck between different sounds, unsure of what to do after possibly peaking too soon. Let&#8217;s just hope this scatter-shot attempt is just a blip for a man who is undoubtedly talented. But it has to be said, the lack of direction on this album means this blip, is best avoided.

_Kinetic World came out on the 15th of June and is available on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/my-devotion/id372852327?i=372852473&ign-mpt=uo%3D6) or through [Plug Music&#8217;s online store](http://www.pluglabel.com/shop/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21_25&products_id=128)._
