It&#8217;s been six years since Blueprint and RJD2 collaborated as Soul Position, and while this technically isn&#8217;t under that name, it might as well be. Don&#8217;t call it a reunion. Whatever it is, it&#8217;s a nice change of direction for both artists.

Blueprint has been handling a lot of his own production recently and has favoured a more electronic style &#8211; to [great results](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/04/review-blueprints-adventures-in-counter-culture/), I might add. It&#8217;s probably not that much of a departure for RJD2 though. His production here does feel a lot more &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; than his recent instrumental album or other collaborative stuff he&#8217;s been putting out recently though.
