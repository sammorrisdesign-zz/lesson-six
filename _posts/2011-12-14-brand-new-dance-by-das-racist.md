I&#8217;ve been listening to a lot of Das Racist recently, it was really easy to quickly dismiss them as joke rap or just plain stupid. But after digging a little deeper you can find someÂ genuine smarts and the right kind of stupid. While all three prepare to release solo mixtapes on New Years Day, the trio have just released &#8220;Brand New Dance&#8221; off their debut LP, Relax.
