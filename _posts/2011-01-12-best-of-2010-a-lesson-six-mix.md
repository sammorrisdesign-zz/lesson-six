It&#8217;s finally time for our 2nd mixcloud release. Last year we released our Soundtrack to the Summer and have been caught in the headlights are was the rest of 2010. But as we begin to move onto an even brighter looking 2011, let&#8217;s celebrate what a great year 2010 was for clich√©-free hip-hop. Here are fourteen tracks from our Best of 2010 awards/lists. They aren&#8217;t in any order, just a nice selection of tracks from across the board.

For those new to our mixes, we should probably point out that you can&#8217;t download it. At Lesson Six we try to support the artists as much as possible and thus put our mixes on [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/LessonSix/). Mixcloud allows you to legally stream our mixes while donating some of the revenue it makes back to the artists. You could also purchase the mix on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewIMix?id=414459263&s=143444) thanks to our handy list. We&#8217;ve also purposely included a bunch of lgetimately free to download tracks, so it&#8217;s cheaper for people pursuing that option. We&#8217;ve also created a [Spotify playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/lessonsix/playlist/7hyXlOWmn8BLZbJg4rkFyD) but they only had four of the fourteen tracks on the mix&#8230;

Enjoy
