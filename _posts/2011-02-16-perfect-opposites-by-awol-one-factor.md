The 2nd single from Awol One & Factor&#8217;s new album &#8220;The Landmark&#8221;, that was released yesterday. They seem intent on taking hip-hop to strange new places, but when it sounds good I can&#8217;t complain as we&#8217;ve got another great track on our hands. Looking forward to giving the full LP a listen.
