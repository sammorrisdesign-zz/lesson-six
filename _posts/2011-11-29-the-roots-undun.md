The Roots have been one of the most successful hip-hop groups ever. Over the past 10 + years, they have consistently released albums and eps that are really good. I would like to think that most hip-hop fans have heard of The Roots, so I&#8217;ll skip the description of their music. In a couple of weeks The Roots are releasing their next piece of work titled Undun. This is their first ever venture into the concept-album and from a first listen, it sounds great.

You can stream the album in full on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2011/11/28/142873013/first-listen-the-roots-undun?ps=mh_frhdl1)

The album comes out on December 6th.
