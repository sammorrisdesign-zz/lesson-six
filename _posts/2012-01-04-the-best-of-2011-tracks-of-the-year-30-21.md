We continue our countdown of the top 50 tracks of 2011 with those just outside the top 20.

<!--more-->

## 30. &#8220;Dope Pusher&#8221; by DJ Format

One of two tracks we heard from the too-silent-for-too-long DJ Format. Let&#8217;s hope that Format continues to break that trend.



## 29. &#8220;Against The Bottom&#8221; by Grieves

The kind of track that makes you want to call over a few friends and just hang out. A good track for the summer time as well.



## 28. &#8220;Say Yes&#8221; by Fresh Daily

It wasn&#8217;t the most clich√©-free or consistant release of 2011 but boy did it have some high points. The one that stood head and shoulders above the rest was the feel good anthem, &#8220;Say Yes&#8221;.



## 27. &#8220;Chalk Up Tomorrow&#8221; by The Physics

The Physics are at there best on tracks like this, when they can combine hip-hop and soul.



## 26. &#8220;The Clouds&#8221; by Blueprint

If there is one thing that Blueprint taught us earlier in the year with is release, Adventures In Counter Culture, it&#8217;s that when he writes about a concept, he knocks it out the park.



## 25. &#8220;So High&#8221; by Awon & Kameleon Beats

More of a laid back track from Concentration Gradient. The sax on the track really adds to the feel of the track. Tiff the Gift also really shines on So High.



## 24. &#8220;The Processional&#8221; by Open Mike Eagle

I&#8217;ll admit that I might have been a little hypercritical of Open Mike Eagle&#8217;s &#8220;Rappers Will Die of Natural Causes&#8221; earlier in the year. While there was something about that didn&#8217;t just click, it definitely has enough noteworthy of tracks. With this excellent album opener being the 2nd time Mike&#8217;s name has appeared on this list.



## 23. &#8220;Mattered Much&#8221; by Oddisee

Mattered Much both the instrumental and the version with Olivier Daysoul is great. The live instrumentation on the track really stands out.



## 22. &#8220;Great Expectations&#8221; by J-Live

J-Live&#8217;s long-awaited album, S.P.T.A, finally saw release this year and although it didn&#8217;t completely live up to lofty expectations previously set way back in 2010, it did have enough about it be one of the best albums of the year. With one of the best tracks being a spiritual successor to another standout track, &#8220;Them That&#8217;s Not&#8221; from his 2001 debut.



## 21. &#8220;Moral of the Story&#8221; by The Woodside Boys

The kind of track that makes you want to call over a few friends and just hang out. A good track for the summer time as well.
