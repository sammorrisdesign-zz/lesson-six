Seattle has been on fire lately, with releases coming out left and right from the various artists that reside in/around the city. Following the release of Cinemetropolis by the Blue Scholars, Prometheus Brown paired with Bambu to release his second album of the summer. This album really caught me by surprise, but I was really happy to know that a new album would be coming out by an all time favorite MC. Prometheus Brown and Bambu rap about a variety of different issues ranging from light hearted to the more serious social commentary. Each track on this album was produced by some one different each time and it allows both Prometheus Brown and Bambu to shine on different styles of production.
