Tor, aka the producer that threw together that Illinoize mixtape that combined underground hip-hop with Sufjan Steven&#8217;s breakthrough album Illinois, has been busy working on a new album. Drum Therapy was due out fairly soon but after being picked up by a label, Tor is going to spend a few months polishing it for a probably June release. In the meantime though, he&#8217;s released orchestral &#8220;Glass &#038; Stone&#8221;.
