While Lasers, Lupe&#8217;s previous full length album might have been a dud, the Friend of the People mix tape showed what Lupe is capable of at his best. In this video for Double Burger With Cheese, Lupe&#8217;s rhymes are dissected and illustrated line by line. This is the type of work Lupe does best.
