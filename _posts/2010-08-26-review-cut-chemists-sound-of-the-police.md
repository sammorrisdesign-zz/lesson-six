It&#8217;s easily forgotten but this thing called Hip Hop originated in Africa. Luckily Cut Chemist is here to you remind you. With his unique ability to dig out the rarest of samples, Cut Chemist proves that he hasn&#8217;t even touched the surface of his talents. That is until he came armed with a bag of Ethiopian, Colombian, Sudanese and Afro-Brazilian records, cross-bred them with some beats you might have heard of and called it Sound of The Police.

<!--more-->It&#8217;s an interesting experiment and a great example of why he is one of the most well known producers we&#8217;ve got. Taking something unexplored and nailing it in the first go. While it&#8217;s definitely not one to blast on repeat for hours, it more than deserves a listen or two, if only because it sounds so different. See it as an extended lesson in diversity.
