German beatmaker Plukk.inn, hot off his recent tape [Bad Habits](http://plukk-inn.bandcamp.com/album/plukk-inn-bad-habits), has teamed up with Lesson Six favourite Raashan Ahmad on this boom bap sounding summer anthem, &#8220;No Pain&#8221;. We&#8217;re already starting to think about our third annual Soundtrack to the Summer, looks like this came out at the right time. Download the track on a name your own price deal, [here](http://plukk-inn.bandcamp.com/track/raashan-ahmad-no-pain-prod-plukk-inn).
