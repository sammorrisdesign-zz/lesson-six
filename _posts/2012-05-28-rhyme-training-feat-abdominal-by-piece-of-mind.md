I&#8217;ll be honest, I was drawn to this track by seeing Abdominal&#8217;s name. The Toronto based MC has been working on a follow up to 2007&#8242;s Escape From The Pigeon Hole for a long time and we&#8217;re happy any time we see The Pedal Pusher&#8217;s name appear on new material. However, like most of time when I listen Canadian artists, I find another favourite to add to the list. Piece of Mind, who also have an album on the horizion, are another artist from north of the border worth following. Oh Canada.
