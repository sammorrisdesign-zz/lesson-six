J-Live is a rare talent. The triple threat of DJ, Producer and Emcee means that J-Live can definitely be labelled a jack of all trades. However, while occasionally all these three elements would come together, they haven&#8217;t consistently through an entire release. The moments of quality made J-Live a deservedly well respected man within hip-hop but he&#8217;s constantly on the verge of his undoubtedly brilliant album.

<!--more-->With S.P.T.A. (Said Person of That Ability) on the horizon, J-Live has treated everyone to a sneak preview, with a short EP called Undivided Attention, just to wet our appetite. So in that sense, this release is an undoubted success. At a half size, seven track count, Undivided Attention definitely captures your attention from the beginning.

J-Live is clearly having to deal with being a jack-of-all-trades and constantly plays on the fact with DJ J-Live, MC J-Live and Producer J-Live interacting with each other throughout the album. It&#8217;s not a concept album per se but the ideas played around with here could definitely lead onto something very interesting. &#8220;Home or Away&#8221; has them joking away on a plane while &#8220;How I Feel Pt.1&#8243; runs out of time before they each get their time on the mic. In having these clearly defined split personalities, J-Live creates the feeling of a group but with a personal touch.

> I said next time skip all that stress / Tell them real DJ&#8217;s don&#8217;t take requests / See we the ghostbusters / Look into the light, the men in black, you can trust us / Forget whatever song you were thinking / We select, you keep dancing and drinking

Elsewhere, J-Live mixes up his internal trio with tracks about gay pride, the white house and faux-reality tv. While I&#8217;m never a fan of angry political hip-hop, here it&#8217;s at a decent length, backed up by good production and done in a fairly tasteful way &#8211; a good poster child for political hip-hop. A few of the featured tracks come of as a little generic but rightfully have a place on the EP because they buffer the conceptual tracks that are so strong.

Unfortunately most of his story telling involving the group takes place in a club. I can understand that for a man like J-Live, that&#8217;s his place of work (for two out of three of his personalities it is anyway). But after listening to Undivided Attention, you get the feeling that the concept could be pushed further. For the most part, the &#8216;trio&#8217; get along and some tension wouldn&#8217;t go a miss in a track or two on the full release, if done well it could be incredibly interesting.

Then again, that&#8217;s probably what Undivided Attention is meant to do &#8211; be short, extremely accessible and brimming with potential. While J-Live hasn&#8217;t released an undoubtedly brilliant album, he has always been on the verge of it and after listening to this, he&#8217;s closer than ever.
