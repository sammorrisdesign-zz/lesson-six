While we&#8217;re really busy organising our upcoming event with Wordburglar & The Ruby Kid, we&#8217;ve still got time for our Monthly Spotify Playlists. I mean, this has been one of the best years for cliché-free hip-hop for a long time, so we should make the most of it. So this is August 2012, with album choices by Muneshine, Serengeti & Dark Time Sunshine along with our favourite tracks from the past month. Follow us on [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/lessonsix) to get updates from future playlists. Hit the jump for the full playlist&#8230;
