I used to love Choose Your Own Adventure books when I was a kid. I still love text based adventure games which share the same roots. So this hip-hop video based Choose Your own Adventure should be right up my street. The song is disjointed but the journey is fun, and the end result is an early video from Ivan Ives. He&#8217;s a cocky young man but he sure talented.
