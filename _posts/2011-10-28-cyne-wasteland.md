After a period of silence and hearing nothing from Cyne, just the other day I got news that a new mixtape will be coming out soon. Since first hearing Cyne, I have been drawn to their full body of work. I was pretty excited to hear new work, and they didn&#8217;t dissapoint. This is a bit different sounding than their previous work, but none the less it is still good.

You can pre order the tape, and yes I mean actual tape, [here](http://home-tapes.com/Hometapes/HAUS_HT048.html)
