A new track from Mr. J Medeiros always makes the day better, and this is a really sweet track. You can download it for free/pay what you want over <a href="http://mrjmedeiros.bandcamp.com/track/the-rockies" target="_blank">here</a>. As always Mr. J is on point with his lyrics and Stro compliments him very well on the production.

On a side note, Mr. J Medeiros and Stro will be performing as The Proccusions, for the first time in a long time so head on over <a href="http://mrjmedeiros.com/#488/tumblr" target="_blank">here</a> to get more info.
