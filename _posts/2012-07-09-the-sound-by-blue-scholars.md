Not really sure whats going on with this track, but as different as it is from the Blue Scholars normal work, it still has a dope beat from Sabzi of his beat tape Parthenia, and some strange lyrics from Geo. Also funny seeing the reaction people have had to this &#8220;ad&#8221; which is what it is basically.
