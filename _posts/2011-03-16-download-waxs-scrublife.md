I&#8217;ve been really pining to listen to something new over the last week and then Wax&#8217;s [Scrublife mixtape](http://waxdotcom.bandcamp.com/album/scrublife-mixtape-hosted-by-dj-skee-dale-firebird) comes out. It doesn&#8217;t completely scratch that itch though, Wax seems like a very schizophrenic artist hoping from subject to subject with reckless abandon to our Clich√©-free profile. That said, there is enough on here to deserve a mention.
