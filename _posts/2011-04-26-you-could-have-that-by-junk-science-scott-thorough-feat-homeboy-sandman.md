Another free track released by Junk Science &#038; Scott Thorough from their upcoming release &#8216;Phoenix Down&#8217;. We managed to talk to Baje One about Modern Shark, his label and a little bit on this new release as part of our soon to be available newspaper. Speaking of which, we&#8217;ve sent it to print and we&#8217;ll let you know when they&#8217;re ready to go.
