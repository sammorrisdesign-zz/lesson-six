This has been sitting on the Dash for awhile now and Lazy Sunday seems the best time to post it. Cee-Lo Green, better known as the singing half of Gnarls Barkley, has released an amazing first single off his upcoming album. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all heard and loved it already but it deserves to be shared again.
