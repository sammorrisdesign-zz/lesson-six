Mello Music Group has been pumping out some dope music this year, and this track reinforces that trend. While this track might not be &#8220;hip-hop,&#8221; there is a definite influence of hip-hop, and the soul pours out of the song. yU and Danedra Rowell fit together very well, and combine to make a uplifting track. Â You can download the track for free <a href="http://mellomusicgroup.bandcamp.com/track/yu-dreams-feat-danedra-rowell" target="_blank">here</a>, or purchase the 7&#8243; vinyl.
