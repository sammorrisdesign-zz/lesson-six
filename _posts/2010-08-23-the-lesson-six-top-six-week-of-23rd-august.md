After Friday&#8217;s big release, I&#8217;m surprised you&#8217;re back for more. What, you want more? Well won&#8217;t worry guys, he&#8217;s gone now. It&#8217;s just you, me and six great tracks for another week. So sit back and enjoy.

## Dynamic Syncopation feat. Mass Influence &#8211; 2 Tha Left

I have no idea what happened to Dynamic Syncopation but they could produce a good beat.



## LMNO &#8211; Working

A brilliant video for one of LMNO&#8217;s better tracks. I&#8217;ve been slightly disheartened when listening to the mass√© of LMNO albums this year, I haven&#8217;t been able to get into any of them.



## Colossus &#8211; The Tribute

Another track from the criminally underrated producer, Colossus.



## Halabisky&#8217;s Uprising feat. Moka Only &#8211; More/Less

Moka Only spills words that just happen to rhyme on this jazz infused track.



## Iller Than Theirs &#8211; After All

I had a bit of an obsession with the song awhile back. It&#8217;s still awesome



## Kidda &#8211; Doo What?

Track by UK happy-go-lucky producer Kidda
