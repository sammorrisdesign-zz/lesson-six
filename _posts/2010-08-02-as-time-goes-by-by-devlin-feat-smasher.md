While the rest of his album is cliché - fitting into the standard formula of _Grime &#8211;_ this track, although pretty depressing, definitely has the positive tip and shows off a real flair for storytelling. This was from 2006, so let&#8217;s hope the last four years have been good for this youngster and have shaped his sound into something lesson6 can get behind.
