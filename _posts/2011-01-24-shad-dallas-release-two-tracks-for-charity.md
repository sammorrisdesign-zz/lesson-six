Shad, winner of our favourite album of 2010, has started 2011 by teaming up with Alexisonfire&#8217;s lead signer, Dallas Green to release a few tracks for charity. Skate4Food will be getting the proceeds of &#8220;Two Tracks&#8221;. One is a remix of Listen from Shad&#8217;s last album but with Green&#8217;s vocals on it. The other is. the more exciting track, is called Live Forever.

If you&#8217;re feeling in a giving mood and love yourself some vinyl, get the limited edition over at [City and Colour](http://www.cityandcolour.ca/store/#D3061).
