For as often as I really appreciate a sample heavy studio-produced beat, it&#8217;s tough to hate live hip-hop groups. May I present the latest in a trend that I hope sticks around for good, ArtOfficial. If you&#8217;re digging this track, and why shouldn&#8217;t you be, then you won&#8217;t have long to wait before sinking your ears into full release. &#8220;Vitamins & Minerals&#8221; comes out next Saturday.
