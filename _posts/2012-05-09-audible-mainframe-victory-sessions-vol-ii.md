It&#8217;s been a little over one month since Audible Mainframe&#8217;s frontman Exposition passed away from cancer, but instead of shutting down operations, Audible Mainframe continues to release music in honor of Expo. This EP is apart of the VICtory sessions, <a href="http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/audible-mainframes-victory-sessions-vol-1/" target="_blank">we reviewed the first one</a>, and this is the music I love. You can download each song individually on sound cloud, and click on the link to find out more information on how you can help fight cancer.
