Last week the now veteran hip-hop triple threat, J-Live released his long coming album Said Person Of That Ability. For some not familiar with his destinctive old school sound, here&#8217;s a quick introduction to DJ J-Live, MC J-Live & Producer J-Live&#8217;s long career.

## The Upgrade

_From the album Then What Happened_



One of the better tracks from his last release.

## Them That&#8217;s Not

_From the album The Best Part_



Storytelling and production combined to make one. Some of his finest work here.

## The Way That I Rhyme

_From the Undivided Attention EP_



It&#8217;s been played everywhere but thoroughly deserved. On the preview EP for SPTA, it&#8217;s going to be hard to top it.

## Braggin&#8217; Writes

_Not first heard on an album but was revisted on The Best Part_



One of the tracks that give him his breakthrough. Beat juggling and rapping at the sametime takes talent.

## The Best Part

_From the album of the same name_



Finishing off with what J-Live does best. That old school sound with Dj Premier on the beat.
