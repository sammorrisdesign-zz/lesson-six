Came across this project yesterday and it seems like a great idea. It&#8217;s well over halfway towards its target with 25 days to go so it looks likely that it will come into being. If you want to support it then head over to the site and [donate](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1801076626/the-hip-hop-word-count-a-searchable-rap-almanac).

Now we can find out who was the first rapper to say fondue. Or Trampoline. The possibilities are endless.
