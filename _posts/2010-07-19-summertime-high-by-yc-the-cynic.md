Another one I&#8217;ve had limited listening time with. But judging on this track alone YC The Cynic could release one hell of an album later in the year. The Spectacle is out in a few months, for now, enjoy this free track from his [BandCamp](http://ycthecynic.bandcamp.com/track/summertime-high) (which also has a decent mixtape, another freebie).
