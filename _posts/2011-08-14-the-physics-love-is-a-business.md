The Physics are another great hip hop outfit from the very vibrant city of Seattle. Since their last full album release the folks making up The Physics have been busy working with a variety of artists in Seattle most notably Blue Scholars. Their latest album Love Is A Business is a more grown up sound than previous music from Future Talk. The music and the content is light hearted but with very catchy up beat production. Like they mention on the bio found on their site, The Physics &#8220;represent SeattleÂ as it is on a clear summer day: laid back, refreshing, and most importantly, at its best.&#8221; This statement stays true on this album and it will leave you signing and humming along to each song.
