Earlier in the week we posted Jazsapiens&#8217; &#8220;Starving Artists&#8221; as part of our Monday Top Six. Well half of the Jazsapiens, Aero-K just released another free mixtape. Called [In-Tune](http://aero-k.bandcamp.com/album/in-tune-mixtape), the album follows the similar styles of decent rhymes with laid back jazz sampled beats. Hard to argue.
