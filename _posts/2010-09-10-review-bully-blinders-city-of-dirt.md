None of their videos have mustered more than a thousand hits on YouTube. Under a hundred people have liked them on Facebook. Their album is now free on BandCamp and nobody seems to have noticed. Some things, like that scene in the second Matrix film, just can&#8217;t be explained.

While I can&#8217;t explain why Bully Blinders aren&#8217;t everywhere at the moment, I can explain what every single one of the nine tracks on their début album is about. City of Dirt is a short thirty minutes of assured production and clear unambiguous lyricism, packed with more depth than you&#8217;ll first think.

<!--more-->Bully Blinders have their way with a plethora of subject matter. Television, cereals, career paths and online predators. Yeah, ignore that last one, at least for a bit. Humour in music, is always a tall order but Bully Blinders do a great job of avoiding the traditional pitfalls. It rarely happens but I&#8217;ve been caught laughing out loud at their creative uses of cereal slogans and names of sitcoms.

> Rather be quality than quantity / Quantum leap / Qualified  to continue and speak and live life free / Rather be looking through a telescope at Mars, than to be starstruck on Hollywood Boulevard

That&#8217;s not to say the album is one big joke. City of Dirt makes a habit of turning political on you to varying success. &#8220;Rather Be&#8221; is a masterclass of keeping a track from being bogged down in political ideas. The brief two minutes are filled with things that he would rather be doing. This can range from obvious facts like quality over quantity to statements like how he&#8217;d rather be in the cold of Canada than coming back from Iraq draped in a flag. Briefly dropping thoughts and ideas on real-world issues is a great way to make it light, listenable and ultimately more enjoyable.

Meanwhile tracks that devote themselves to such ideas, tend to miss. &#8220;Aim Low Kid&#8221; and &#8220;You Only Hear What You Want To Hear&#8221; focus on the dumbing down of teaching because of the media and children being prayed upon by internet predators, respectively. It&#8217;s quite odd actually. Although the creepy &#8220;Can&#8217;t Imagine&#8221; tops them both.

City of Dirt is easily one of my favourite listens of the year. At only nine tracks, Bully Blinders deliver confident production and a plethora of topics. However, the fact that there&#8217;s a track complaining about entertainment dumbing down children and a track about how great television is says something. While a majority of the tracks are great on their own, some don&#8217;t feel right as part of one album. Not that, that changes anything &#8211; City of Dirt is still a brilliant selection of tracks that deserve to be listened to.
