Sabzi, the man behind the production for Blue Scholars and numerous groups released a set of instrumentals a few days ago. These beats sound a lot like his work from the Oof! EP, but there is a little bit more going on. Listening to this you feel like breaking out and free styling over these beats.

The full album, PARTHENIA, is available through [his Bandcamp](http://sabzi.bandcamp.com/album/parthenia) through one of those &#8220;name your price&#8221; deals.
