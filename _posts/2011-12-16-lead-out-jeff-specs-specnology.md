Lead Out is a new feature were we talk to artists who have recently released an album. In the first week we talk to Vancouver MC, Jeff Spec, to find out more about his recently released album Specnology. Which, if you haven&#8217;t listened to, get on [this](http://jeffspec.bandcamp.com/album/specnology).

_Lesson Six: You seem to have a lot more personal tracks on Specnology than you did on I Did it For Kicks, was this a conscious effort? and what else did you set out to achieve with this album that you didn&#8217;t on your last?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Jeff Spec: I guess it&#8217;s all perception&#8230; If I was asked, I&#8217;d say that Sneakerboxxx (the I Did It For Kicks one) was more personal to me for the most part. But I try to go in on some real topics whenever I make a record &#8211; this is my 18th &#8211; because I know people can relate when I talk about things that matter to me.  As far as a conscious effort to get more or less personal, not really. My deal on Specnology was to revisit the aesthetic of the classics that inspired me when I was growing up, but try to push things along with the skills and all that.
</p>

_L6: I&#8217;d imagine that the title track Specnology goes down really well live. How&#8217;s the new stuff been going down at gigs?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  JS: Yeah man, Specnology is always a major highlight at the live shows, as well as Clyde Stubblefield, which is always a bit of a workout on stage.
</p>

_L6: There are some really good points made on Radio!, is this something that&#8217;s been brewing for awhile?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  JS: Well yeah… I mean I got into hip hop through older friends, then of course by listening to the radio. There were always outlets where you could hear real music &#8211; then when I started getting into the clubs, it was an extension of the same thing. These days, the DJ&#8217;s I meet that actually play what they like or something new that people might not know, I can count on one hand. There&#8217;s this culture of fear that if you step outside of the box, the dancefloor is gonna clear out, people are going to change the station, or whatever. Then that extends to the artists, who end up biting whatever else is happening. Being from the era I&#8217;m from, I can&#8217;t accept that. They call us haters when we express a valid opinion too, but that&#8217;s cool.
</p>

_L6: What&#8217;s your personal favourite track on the album and why?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  JS: I have to go with Remember Me, another one of the personal joints on the record. The beat is a banger that I got from my boy Deezuz, who&#8217;s still relatively new to production, but I was really impressed. I got into the concept of being immortal through what you leave behind &#8211; in my case, music &#8211; and people&#8217;s obsession with death and how it changes the perception of artists when they&#8217;re gone. But really, when I do a record, I try to think in terms of the overall picture, so the album is meant to be like a painting, where every piece is essential.
</p>

> I included I&#8217;ve Been Trying on the album and put it first because it set the tone for where my head is at, and I think people that know me have come to expect honesty and personal content.

_L6: Why aren&#8217;t there more tracks about Clyde Stubblefield?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  JS: A really sad thing that happened with a lot of the players on so many classic albums is that they got totally lost in the liner notes on albums. A lot of people have probably seen the documentary &#8220;Standing In The Shadows Of Motown&#8221;, which is about the Funk Brothers (a rotating personnel of Motown players), and how they were kind of the unsung heroes of popular music for so much of the 20th century. Clyde was in the same boat. James Brown just referred to him as the &#8220;Funky Drummer&#8221;, which is a name that people are likely more familiar with than anything. So I thought putting his name on my song would be a nice homage, especially with the whole &#8216;give the drummer some&#8217; concept.
</p>

_L6: Some classic sample work on Remember Me and Specnology, it really makes those track stand out. Who did the production on the album as whole?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  JS: I did half of the joints on the album, and then there&#8217;s Deezuz, who I mentioned earlier, and Impossible Nothing, Engine (who&#8217;s done beats for a ton of well-known artists), and Muneshine (who also gets out there).
</p>

_L6: The Bells?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  JS: This is a tribute to 80s hip hop, and of course there&#8217;s those bells in the beat that made me just want to go in. The homey Impossible Nothing actually chopped up a big industry record by one of the biggest quasi-hip-hop artists out right now, put some real hard drums in, and made it crazy. This is what hip hop is about to me &#8211; sample anything, make it your own, and make it knocking. When I grew up, rappers all sounded different from each other, and shit was edgy. There weren&#8217;t any guidelines or rules, because the groundwork was being put down and people were hungry. You had to make a name by bringing something new to the table, or you were wack, straight up. I&#8217;m not afraid to show that I&#8217;m intelligent, educated, whatever &#8211; whoever I am, that&#8217;s who I&#8217;ll be on the record. That&#8217;s how you build longevity. It takes longer, but it&#8217;s worth it not to be a clown.
</p>

_L6: Any stories behind any of the tracks?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  JS: No crazy stories about the actual studio sessions or anything, but I&#8217;ve Been Trying is definitely a pretty conceptual thing I did. I guess you could say it&#8217;s about the whole quarter-life-crisis stage of life… Just to clarify, I&#8217;m in a great place, but we all go through some things at different stages. Being a grown man, knowing that a lot of the audience now is grown, it seemed like something that would work. I make a lot of songs, and I did this one because I noticed that a lot of things were changing for me at the time and felt I had to address them. I included it on the record and put it first because it set the tone for where my head is at, and I think the people that know me have come to expect honesty and personal content.
</p>

_L6: Anyone you would thank or mention?_

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  JS: Well, thank you first of all for giving me the time and space to talk about Specnology and getting out to some new heads who may not be familiar with me. And of course, I need to say thanks to everyone who contributed to Specnology &#8211; the producers I mentioned earlier, and everyone who lent vocals &#8211; Rasul Syed, Ishkan, Moka Only, Reflectionz, Psy, e.d.g.e., David Morin, Adi Baybay, and Claire Mortifee. All geniuses in my opinion. Of course, the album is available on <a href="http://www.jeffspec.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> and people can check in with me at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jeffspec">Twitter</a> & <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jeff.spec">Facebook</a>.

_Lesson Six would like to thank Jeff Spec for taking the time to answer our questions. _
