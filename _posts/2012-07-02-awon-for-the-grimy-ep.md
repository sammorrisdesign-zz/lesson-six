I think it&#8217;s safe to say Awon has been putting out some dope music over the past year, and this EP is no letdown. While this sounds a bit different from the outstanding Concentration Gradient from last year, this EP contains the same great storytelling from Awon accompanied by some great production. This EP is as Awon describes it &#8220;represents the art of emceeing,&#8221; and well it does.
