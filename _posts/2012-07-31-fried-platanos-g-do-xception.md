G-DO & Xception are back with the second single for their upcoming album. This one features a different type of sound than I was expecting, and it is good. With the first single they released, I think I remarked on how it sounded very similar to their previous album. The change of sound shows that G-DO & Xception can vary their style up and continue to put out great music.
