This is a crazy little EP by Massachusetts lyricist H.W. He&#8217;s probably got the least SEO-friendly artist name on the planet but you&#8217;ll learn more about him by listening than any amount of googling would do. The life-lessons on &#8220;Wall Papered Exit Wounds&#8221; serve as a great introduction to the introspective rapper. Sometimes this kind of hip-hop can get a bit cringe worthy unless it&#8217;s got a very intelligent wordsmith at the helm, and on this short EP H.W. appears to be fairly assured on the mic. From an initial listen it seems to be packed with quotables, like this off &#8220;Blueprints To Your Inner Workings&#8221;,

> &#8220;and I’m as bad as it gets, the wounded soldier / still strung together in hopes I’ve kept my composure / its like, I spend my days searching cities of lost / so tired from the expedition I forgot where I was&#8221;.

It&#8217;s available on a pay-what-you like deal with no minimum on his [Bandcamp](http://longlivehw.bandcamp.com/releases).
