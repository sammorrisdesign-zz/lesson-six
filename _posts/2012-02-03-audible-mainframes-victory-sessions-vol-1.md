Audible Mainframe has been one of my favorite groups over the past few years to listen too. They have a perfect combination of the rough and rich(lyrical quality) raps and the live band feel that is so enjoyable to listen too. Their last album Transients was both inspirational and fun to listen too. Over the past year though, AMF has gone through some rough times as their lead MC, Expo was diagnosed with cancer. Instead of folding, AMF continued to make music, and they supported Expo more than ever. The VICtory Sessions are a series of EP&#8217;s with tracks that they have been working on over the past couple of years and that they continue to work on.

> &#8220;Therefore I just take it as it comes one foot in front of the other  walk to the beat of the drum, but if you look close you see your path is already laid out, so follow that until the credits fade out&#8221;

The first volume starts off with their track [Ready To Fly](http://youtu.be/N3XIxA52KG4) (click to view the video). Ready to Fly is a very inspirational track with Expo laying down rhymes about his life, the bands lives and how they love making music and this track really highlights his fight over cancer. Yet, in a way AMF rises above the issue of cancer and continues to put out great music that makes you bob your head. Expo is still as strong as ever with his rhymes. The guitar and bass on tracks like Ready to Fly and Blast Off really add another dimension to the production that most artists don&#8217;t have. The track [04 I See What You&#8217;re Doin (And I Like It)](http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/04-I-See-What-Youre-Doin-And-I-Like-It.mp3) is a fun track with a catchy chorus and showcases the less serious side of Expo and AMF. The combination of having their message being both socially conscious and positive and the live band feel really set AMF apart from other live bands.
