Earlier in the week our returning columist [Kwes talked to Sole](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/07/letters-from-the-front-on-the-state-of-being-an-interview-with-sole/) about his unique and robust take on political hip-hop. It was a great insight to the guy behind the lyrics and the lyrics themselves. But Sole has been a busy man lately. Despite only recently succeeding with his [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1618642281/a-ruthless-criticism-of-everything-existing) to help fund his new album, he&#8217;s just shared the new track &#8220;No Presidents&#8221;. In his own words, he &#8220;took Dead Presidents by Jay-Z and fucked it all up&#8221;. This is the 3rd track from _Nuclear Winter Vol 3_, a forthcoming free mixtape, with Sole promising a strong 90s theme throughout.
