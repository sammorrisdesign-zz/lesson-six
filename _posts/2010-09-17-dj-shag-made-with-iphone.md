[](http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DJ-Shag-header.jpg)I came across DJ Shag when Sam accidentally uncovered a release by a group called Supa Unknown (check back next week for more on that). The group comprises of members from The West Indies and the man himself. He hasn&#8217;t rested on this release, as you can see by cheking out his [website](http://www.shagbeats.com), instead he has recorded a brand new album around a unique concept.

<!--more-->Made With iPhone is an entire album made with, well, an iPhone. The 4th edition to be precise. I recently inquired about how he has done this and he was nice enough to educate me; &#8220;All of the beats were made using various apps on the iphone, and then tracked out in pro tools.&#8221; Not only that but he&#8217;s also planning on producing a video for the first single using nothing but his iPhone and a cinematic lens attachment.

&#8220;I am really trying to show people that you don&#8217;t need expensive equipment to make a great album and video.&#8221; Check out these two videos to get a feel for the album.





The album will not be completely instrumental, featuring emceeing from some California based emcees. Dj Shag has given us a free track for you to download and listen to.

&#8220;One of the three songs to lead the single is called &#8221; Technology &#8221; which is a 6 emcee posse cut about how technology effects everyone. The emcees featured on it are Blame One, Jimmy Powers, Sojourn, Kaus, and the Anti Citizens. All from the San Diego California area&#8221;

Expect more on this album as it happens. We hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are!
