Now I know this is only the seventh Top Six but I&#8217;m starting to lose track. While digging through iTunes I found a few suitable tracks that, apparently, we had already posted. There&#8217;s probably an easier way to do this. Anyway here&#8217;s another top six, the best yet?

## J-Live &#8211; The Way That I Rhyme

We posted his most recent release the other day and while visiting his Bandcamp for the embed code I stumbled upon this track. Apparently I missed its June release earlier in the year. I&#8217;m sorry J-Live, I&#8217;m making up for it now though.



## Bully Blinders &#8211; Continental Breakfast

Songs about cereal are the new songs about being an underground rapper.



## Incise &#8211; Paving The Way

My second favourite track on this brilliant album. I&#8217;m going to shamelessly plug [the review](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/08/review-incises-daily-methods/) now. Thanks.



## Jeff Spec &#8211; On My Feet

I know we only posted this a few weeks back but the man was kind enough to hook us up with his album and this list is meant to be the best of what we&#8217;ve been listening to.



## 7L &#038; Esoteric &#8211; Get Dumb

The sarcastically challenged need not apply.



## Atmosphere &#8211; Yesterday

I&#8217;m going to leave you on a different note this week. Here&#8217;s the brilliantly sombre &#8220;Yesterday&#8221; by Atmosphere.
