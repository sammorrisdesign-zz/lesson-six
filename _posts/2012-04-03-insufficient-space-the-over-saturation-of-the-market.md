Over the past few years, with the rise of blogs and other media sources, the opportunities of exposure for many artists has increased. In order for the less exposed artists to say relevant in the music scene, they feel a strong need to release more music, meaning they release a new single, album, EP, or mix-tape more often. Some artists like The Roots, or People Under The Stairs have released many albums, but there is a difference in the quality of each of their releases versus the artist who releases a new song every few days that they just worked on.

So whats the problem with this? Well, there are two main concerns that I have with this ever growing practice. One of the biggest problems, in my eyes, is that if one artist is releasing more music just to get there name out there then it most likely causes the quality of the music they release to drop. The other problem is that this buries the real good music further down the line because what we hear and see on many blogs is the newest music, not necessarily the best.

Many times, when I browse through blogs and look at the number of times they post about different artists music everyday it can be overwhelming. It becomes all to easy to become focused on bragging rights for being the first to get the scoop. This is really unhelpful because when looking for new music, I have to sort through an artist&#8217;s recent releases that I don’t really like listening too, just because they released a few selections from his work all within a small period. It’s not always just one artist releasing new music either, in many cases it is seeing 15 new releases from 15 different artists everyday on a blog. This happens because of the I want to be the first to show everyone this new thing mentality that we have.

Personally, for me this practice that blogs have makes finding the music I love harder to find. It is extremely hard to find music that I will buy or download and still be listening too just three or four days down the line, if I am finding a constant stream of new music everyday. There are way too many times where I get a song or album that I listen to once, and then I never listen too it again even though it sounded great because I heard another great album just the next day. When your music collection is upwards of 200 albums, it becomes very hard to listen to those albums you got three days ago and continue listening to the albums that you have enjoyed for years. I mean how much time in one day do we have to listen too music only, it’s not enough. It takes a lot of effort to sort through hundreds of posts found on various blogs to find the music that we will continually listen too over and over again. This process is very tedious and time consuming, but it is one that is well worth it for a true music aficionado. What makes this process a lot harder though is having to go through releases from artists who released music just to have their name out there, even though it isn’t great quality because many blogs just post the latest release. This process is part of where the problem lies, because as a listener we can&#8217;t keep up with all these new songs released by a plethora of artists everyday without just hearing it once and moving on.

> &#8220;I ain&#8217;t trying to be one of them dudes, that make hundreds of songs but none of them are good / some of them are cool but they ain&#8217;t saying nothing new / running through verse just for some to do&#8221;

This problem has become more widespread over the years. I ask my friends all the time how many songs do you have on your iPod and many of those times, their response is normally in the high thousands. How many of those songs do you actually listen to over and over again? I have the same problem as well. Just a few days ago, I decided to clean out my library, and I was able to delete over a thousand songs which I probably listened to only once. It&#8217;s becoming impossible to keep up with everything we _must_ listen to.

Another byproduct is that the quality of the individual releases drops over time because artists feel the need to release more music sooner. How many artists release a new EP, album, mix tape or a song every few weeks. How much is enough? I understand that a lot of artists are constantly working on music, because it&#8217;s their livelihoods, but artists like Blue Scholars, Mr. J Medeiros & Cyne do a great job of making new releases feel like an event. How many artists today release music with the same generic production instead of trying something new and different, and then they talk about the same things on every song? It is an easily avoidable problem if those artists try to release fewer songs, but put more effort into those one or two songs every month instead of ten or twelve songs. How many things can one artist talk about, and how many different quality beats and different styles can one artist really come up with when something is being released every couple of days. But, then again what is one of the biggest causes of why these artists release so many new songs? Its, us, the fans of these artists clamoring for new music, instead of appreciating their older work, and listening to their previous music more than just three or four times. Can we really even judge an artists latest release if we have only listened to the album three or four times? Most music takes time to grow on us as listeners, and its hard to listen to one album you like if the artist keeps releasing new music.

So then what is the solution to this problem? Well, there are many different ways to try to increase the quality and decrease the quantity of releases. For one, us as fans can really change how often artists release their music. If we stop downloading all these singles and remixes of the same song that an artist constantly releases, they will know what the fans want. Another thing that can be done is if blogs stop posting the newest material for the sake of posting material first. One thing that happens differently here than other sites is that we aren&#8217;t in a rush to post the newest music, and we definitely don&#8217;t shy away in posting older music we may have missed. Too many of the times though, blogs post the newest song because they want the recognition that they found the music first or whatever. Instead of going for being first, the quality of the music and even words we write about that music should have more importance.

In the end though, it is really hard to pin down just one or two solutions because many of the solutions to this problem lie with the very way the music market works. Fans want to hear new music everyday, blogs want to post the newest music everyday, and artists will cater to their audience. The whole mentality of the way we consume music needs to change.
