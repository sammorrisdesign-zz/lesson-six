Recently I went to see Macklemore &#038; Ryan Lewis kick off their European Tour here in London. It&#8217;s probably the first time I&#8217;ve ever felt old at a gig, because unbeknownst to be it was freshers gig. But then I just used unbeknownst in a sentence so I guess that was inevitable, freshers week or not.

While most of the gig was compromised off their cheesy club tracks, occasionally they rolled out their unique form of beautiful hip-hop. Tracks like &#8220;Same Love&#8221; personify why we love Macklemore &#038; Ryan Lewis on Lesson Six. Relatively untouched subject matter, on-point lyrics and Lewis&#8217;s moving production.
