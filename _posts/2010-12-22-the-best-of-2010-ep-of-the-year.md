EPs are meant to fill in the gaps between major releases but with the quality that 2010 has delivered, some EPs were amongst the greatest releases we&#8217;ve had this year. We&#8217;ve had some excellent short albums from some of the best artists on the scene. Here are our favourite five.

My Son The Hurricane &#8211; Check The Barometer

They might not look like your average hip-hop group with backing from a rhythm and brass band behind them but My Son The Hurricane were easily one of the better surprises of the year. With tracks like &#8220;Ain&#8217;t My Style&#8221; on it, _Check The Barometer_ quickly became one of our soundtracks to the summer. Unfortunately the five track EP quickly ended, leaving us wanting more. Luckily, they&#8217;re currently in the studio working on a full 2011 release. Definitely one to keep an eye out for.

Earlier in the year Open Mike Eagle released the intellectual, _Unapologetic Art Rap,_ to a decent reception. It was a little too early for us, with our summer launch, but he managed to squeeze in a follow up EP, _Art Rap After Party_, just before we compiled our end of year lists. More referential, more thought-out and more experimental production meant that this deserves a place on this list.

Carrying on in similar vein, Baje One&#8217;s collaboration with producer J. Howells Werthmann was another weird one. If anything, it&#8217;s even more inaccessible than the comparatively main stream releases Baje makes with Snafu under the Junk Science moniker, but we&#8217;re a sucker for anything different. While it&#8217;s all great stuff, it contains my personal track of the year in &#8220;Tiny Drill&#8221;. Leaving _What&#8217;s It Gonna Be_ as highly recommendable and worthy of a listen.

Is this an album or two EPs stuck together. The sub-subtitle of _The Atmosphere EPs_ means we should probably treat it as so. With a plethora of moods, styles and themes, To All My Friends is quintessentially an Atmosphere release. Loads of experimentation with Slug&#8217;s new storytelling prowess along with loads of instant classics made up of the traditional formula of more personal bars. Is it an album? If it helps them make more music like this, we don&#8217;t care how it&#8217;s labelled.

Released as teaser for J-Live&#8217;s 2011 album SPTA, Undivided Attention towered head and shoulders above the rest. J-Live has always been verging on greatness with a mixed bag of quality throughout his long career behind the mic, desk or turntables. Back with his split personalities in full effect, Undivided Attention did exactly what it was meant to do, get us excited for the full release. And if that full release is as good as this teaser, I can see J-Live topping a few list&#8217;s next year as well.
