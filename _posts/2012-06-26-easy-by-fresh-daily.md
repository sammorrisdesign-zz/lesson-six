Knocksteady are still doing a fine job with their [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/knocksteadyTV) and continue not to disappoint when they gave Fresh Daily a chance to kick it like soccer games. Easily one of the best tracks off Fresh Daily&#8217;s excellent 2011 release,Â [The Quiet Life](http://freshdaily.bandcamp.com/album/the-quiet-life) (so good we featured it on last year&#8217;s [Soundtrack to the Summer 2](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/09/soundtrack-to-the-summer-2/)).
