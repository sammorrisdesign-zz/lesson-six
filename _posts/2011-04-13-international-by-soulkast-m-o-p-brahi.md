Not sure if I ever pictured M.O.P. on this blog but here it is, it&#8217;s happening. Saying that I&#8217;ve always appreciated M.O.P.&#8217;s energy but never really appreciated what they do with that energy. This is more foreign language hip-hop anyway. Which is something I&#8217;m making the conscious effort to give more of a go recently. It&#8217;s odd that the rhyming is still impressive despite the lack of awareness or understanding.
