I would have preferred &#8220;The Crown&#8221; but a video for &#8220;Bad About You&#8221; from, another one of Seattle&#8217;s promising pool of talent, The Good Sin will have to do. Who&#8217;s album, _The Story of Love & Hate_, is due out next spring. But in the meantime go back and check out his free EP, &#8220;Late&#8221;, it&#8217;s safe to say it will be on our top five free releases of the year.
