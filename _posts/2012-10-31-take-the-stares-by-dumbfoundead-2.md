The opening track off Dumbfoundead&#8217;s new album of the same name. After listening to his latest release, I think I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that his album&#8217;s are always going to have polarising tracks on them. Although I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he released an album of undoubtedly high quality track to track sometime soon. He showcases a little bit of that magic here.
