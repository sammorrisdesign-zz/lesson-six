_For the first time we&#8217;re going to allow our favourite artists have a say on their favourite artists. So before we finish up with our album of the year list, let&#8217;s hear what others thought of the past 12 months in music. First off, Ugly Duckling&#8217;s Andy Cooper._

Who could forget 2011? A year filled with, um, well, there was that one time when, uh&#8230;darn, I don&#8217;t remember anything. after 365 days, it can all become a blur but, somehow, I do recall some really good music so as I groove my way into 2012, I would like to submit my favorite albums of 2011 in no particular order&#8230;

## Amy Winehouse&#8217;s &#8220;Hidden Treasures&#8221;

&#8220;Our Day Will Come&#8221; and &#8220;The Girl From Ipanema&#8221; are two of my favorite songs so i was very happy to hear Miss.Winehouse&#8217;s beehiving versions along with some other really cool tracks in this collection.

## The Funk League&#8217;s &#8220;Funky As Usual&#8221;

The French DJ crew from paris put together a nice, little album with a production sound that harkens back to the early 90&#8242;s era in hip-hop with guest performers like Large Professor, Diamond D and Sadat X.

&nbsp;

## People Under The Stairs&#8217; &#8220;Highlighter&#8221;

The Los Angeles rap duo presented the latest chapter in their musical legacy by experimenting with live instrumentation and new sampling techniques.

## Alison Krauss & Union Station&#8217;s &#8220;Paper Airplane&#8221;

I was raised on bluegrass and, in my opinion, Alison Krauss has become the first lady of mountain music. with a voice from heaven and a talented group of musicians around her, she always delivers.

## The Excitements&#8217; &#8220;The Excitements&#8221;

Hi-powered funk to move your rump.



## Lonely Island &#8220;Turtlenecks & Chain&#8221;

What can I say, this musical comedy team makes me laugh and want to &#8220;Do The Creep&#8221;; is that wrong?

## Tom Caruana presents Wu-Tang vs. Jimi Hendrix&#8217;s &#8220;Black Gold&#8221;

It sounds exactly like the album title would lead you to believe it would. mash-ups that skillfully combine drums breaks, guitar feedback, dirty bastards and jimi&#8217;s unique brand of acid-talk.

## <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3830" title="Charles_Bradley-No_Time_For_Dreaming_b" src="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Charles_Bradley-No_Time_For_Dreaming_b-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Charles Bradley&#8217;s &#8220;No Time For Dreaming&#8221;

Charles Bradley looks like he was exhumed from a soul graveyard to shout some life back into the genre. If he and sharon jones had a baby, that child could sweat though an astronaut&#8217;s suit.

## The Beach Boys &#8220;Smile&#8221;

Locked in the vaults since the late 60&#8242;s, this long-awaited and legendary collection of songs could never live up to the decades of hope and hype centered around brian wilson&#8217;s unfinished masterpiece. That said, it&#8217;s still great to listen to such unique and cleverly constructed pop from music&#8217;s heyday.

## Ugly Duckling &#8220;Moving at Breakneck Speed&#8221;

During my 4th grade, student-council election, my teacher Mrs.Daniels told those of us who were running for office that we&#8217;d be foolish not to vote for ourselves.



_We&#8217;ll be back with another guest list, tomorrow&#8230;_
