Running a site about specific subgenre of hip-hop can have it&#8217;s drawbacks when receiving new releases in your inbox. Occasionally though it throws up gems like this. I had no idea Jeff Spec was working on something, although given howÂ prolific he&#8217;s been, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised. Here he teams up with producer REL!G!ON to create an album that &#8220;has a soulful sound with an edge to it&#8221;. Which is a pretty good way of framing it. It&#8217;s a really good evolution in sound for an emcee who&#8217;s now into double figures when it comes to LP releases. Available now on a pay what you want deal.
