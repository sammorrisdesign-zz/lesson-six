ASFP&#8217;s came out a few months ago, and I really slept on the album. The first thing you should know about the album is what the tagline is on the release notes: &#8220;An album about boys and girls for men and women.&#8221; It is an album full of love songs or songs related to love. Initially, I was a little bit hesitant to listen to the album, then I started to really pay attention to each track. To make things clear, this album is not only for woman, it can be enjoyed by anyone and it should be enjoyed. The album starts of on fire with the first three tracks especially &#8220;Jack Kerouac.&#8221; Take a listen to the album and purchase it.
