Great video to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis&#8217;s second single from their album The Heist coming out next month. You can tell these guys have fun making music and just enjoy themselves. This is also really similar to Macklemore&#8217;s song/video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhf5cuXiLTA" target="_blank">And We Danced</a> which is hilarious in its own right. With this single and the previous single Same Love, we can expect a variety of different styles on the album.
