Clear Soul Forces came up on my radar a few months back, but I basically just pushed the music away and forgot about it. This past weekend though, I stumbled upon the group again, and this time I listened to their entire album and man was I impressed. I&#8217;m glad I rediscovered Clear Soul Forces again, because this is some great music from Detroit. You can download the full album <a href="http://clearsoulforces.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>
