Wow these are coming around quick and fast. Here&#8217;s another Ugly Duckling sample, this time Simon Haseley&#8217;s &#8220;Hammerhead&#8221; is used to great affect. Or if you prefer, Simon Haseley is [Portable Payback](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgOHDJuns7o) aka Soup and Marc7 of Jurassic 5 fame.
