Gabriel Teodros is set to release Colored Peoples Time Machine next month. Since hearing his first album Lovework, I have been waiting for a new solo project. Teodros does a brilliant job of telling stories and conveying issues. CPMT is a more ambitious work and Teodros does it brilliantly. Be on the lookout for the album and heres a little sneak peek.
