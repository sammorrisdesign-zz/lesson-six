I think its safe to say that Oddisee is easily one of the best producers out there right now. Last year, he released The Rock Park Creek EP which was a soundtrack to one of his favorite spots to visit, and it featured some dope live instrumentation. Now we have news that a new album is coming out, titled People Hear What They See, and this one features Oddisee as an MC as well, which is something we haven&#8217;t heard in a while. You can pre-order the album on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/preorder/people-hear-what-they-see/id516334681" target="_blank">iTunes</a>.
