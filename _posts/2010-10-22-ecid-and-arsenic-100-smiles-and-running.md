If you go to _Ecid&#8217;s_ Bandcamp page and read the lengthy album description you will see these words, &#8220;emphasis on making every word count&#8221;. It&#8217;s a good ideal to pursue, but in doing so you can overload the listener or lack the catchy hooks that music, no matter how much it tries not to be _pop_, needs. Other linguistically versitile artists like _Homeboy Sandman_ have managed it and so deos _Ecid_, just in a different way.

There&#8217;s a lot of raw emotion from _Ecid_ in this album, a lot of anger. Most of it is directed at his family, his past and a large chunk, some intentional, some hidden, is at his recently divorced wife. &#8220;Heart shaped Boombox&#8221; sums this up perfectly, &#8220;I wear my heart on my sleeve, &#8217;cause a boombox beats in my chest, beep, beep  beep&#8230;&#8221;

The anger is always present and verges out of the Lesson 6 mantra on several occasions. The rhymes are intelligent throughout with clever angles and dark similes, speaking of drugs, death, life and fame. The anger and speedy delivery often works perfectly, but sometimes feels a little forced. I want to hear him relax and play about more, like he does on &#8220;Foot Prints&#8221;.

> I&#8217;m looking for my escape from Alcatraz / in the bottom of a copper flask, listening to Jazz / But I&#8217;m not a big fan of the big band cookie cutter garbage / I&#8217;m truly inspired by those avant-garde artists / I treat my records like I would treat my children / I&#8217;d never sell a single one and keep them in good condition

It&#8217;s really chilled with some witty lyrics and a brilliant lazily sung chorus. The content can still be dark but the delivery can be lighter. It&#8217;s a much cleaner package where you can focus on the message. _Arsenic_ lays down a great beat as he does throughout the entire album. Moving from funky guitars to piano chords but always rooted in this 60&#8242;s/70&#8242;s pop/soul sound. It&#8217;s really impressive, reminds me of _Thes One&#8217;s_ _Lifestyle Marketing_ in parts. But it&#8217;s best on the tracks I&#8217;ve mentioned, often overusing certain sounds on the angrier/darker tracks.

Without _Arsenic&#8217;s_ beats the album would be nowhere near as good as it is. He steps it up again on &#8220;Crawl&#8221;, letting _Ecid_ bounce vocals with _Kristoff Krane_, their verses passing back and forth with the slow beat inbetween the eerie chorus and the haunting flute. &#8220;Damn it Fells Good to be a Charmer&#8221;, a positive track at last, intentionally follows the ex-wife bashing &#8220;What Was I Thinking&#8221; and the  two work really well together, a downer followed by an upper. It shows that _Ecid_ can spit about life while still having his distinctive style.

_100 Smiles and Running_ is a solid album, it just verges on cliché a little too often. If you are going through a divorce then maybe you&#8217;ll relate to Ecid&#8217;s anger. If not, then there&#8217;s still some fun, introspective tracks matched by some _Bonobo_ like beats form _Arsenic_.
