As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve already heard the bad news that influential soul poet, Gil Scott Heron has passed away at the age of 62. The term &#8220;Godfather of Rap&#8221; is entirely accurate as Gil Scott Heron&#8217;s innovative street poetry in the 70s inspired a new generation of artists that were eventually labelled as hip-hop. So we&#8217;re going to honor him the only way we know how. RIP Gil Scott Heron.
