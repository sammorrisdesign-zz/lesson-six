Every week we ask a different artist to tell us what they&#8217;ve been listening to. This week we&#8217;ve given Ottawa based emcee, Kwes, the floor. He sent the list to us, prefacing it with &#8220;this _could_ be viewed as shameless promotion, but this is literally what I&#8217;ve been banging over the past week and abit. Take a listen and disagree with me&#8221;

# &#8220;Dolls&#8221; by Dream Jefferson

</object>

I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s really anything I can say about this that would do it justice, so I&#8217;ll just say this: Dream Jefferson (Owel Five & Corboe) are the future.  This is song five and a half minutes long and the second half of the song is the chorus.  Who can pull that shit off and still have you hitting repeat?  Dream Jefferson.

# &#8220;All Crushed Under the Same Terrible Wheel&#8221; by Flight Distance

</object>

Ottawa&#8217;s best.  Hands down.  Bender <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv00qJWech8" target="_blank">(KOTD champ)</a> and Patience kill shit over a Crack Moses neck breaker.  If you don&#8217;t recognize any of these names it&#8217;s time to step your everything game up.

# &#8220;The Kid&#8217;s Racist (Dopamine Remix)&#8221; by OG Hindu Kush

<span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mook-life/dopamine-remix">Dopamine Remix</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mook-life">Mook Life</a></span>

It isn&#8217;t as dope as <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mook-life/the-kids-racist-original-track" target="_blank">the original</a>, produced by Boots, but to avoid playing out the original while I&#8217;m waiting for my copy of <a href="http://www.stepyourlifegameup.com/store/" target="_blank">&#8220;OG Hindu Kush: In 3-D&#8221;</a> to arrive, I&#8217;ve been playing this (which to me is the best out of the remixes offered up at <a href="http://www.mook-life.com/the-rice-report-the-art-of-the-remix/" target="_blank">Mook-Life.com</a>).

# &#8220;Can&#8217;t You See Part II&#8221; by The Truth

</object>

All bars, no chorus, beautifully produced by the UK&#8217;s BRVNJES.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcmInValATA" target="_blank">Dope video too</a>. Right now I&#8217;m working on a project with Truth which is going to be nothing like what people might expect from listening to our albums.

# &#8220;Cheeba Cheeba / Raw Dog&#8221; by Crack Moses



From his upcoming &#8220;Crack Moses&#8221; LP. There are no recordings of this track available online so you have to settle for the live performance. Produced the upcoming Flight Distance album and Celebration of Life (featuring The Narcicyst) off of &#8220;OG Hindu Kush: In 3-D&#8221;, dude is unfuckwitable.

# &#8220;Never Forgive Action Figures&#8221; by Lynks &#038; Owel Five

</object>

Dream Jefferson and Lynks are all Ottawa natives raising their flag in Toronto right now and I don&#8217;t know what to tell you other than to reiterate: the future.  Seriously, have you heard electro/dance hip hop like this before? No? Didn&#8217;t think so. Owel iggidy-immolates himself over this beat.

_Thanks to Kwes for taking the time and sharing what he&#8217;s been listening to. Next week we&#8217;ve got Inspired Flight on the imagery jukebox._
