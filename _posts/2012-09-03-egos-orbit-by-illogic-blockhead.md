New visuals off the atmospheric &#8220;Ego&#8217;s Orbit&#8221; off Illogic & Blockhead&#8217;s collaborative release _Preparing For Capture 2_. If I wasn&#8217;t convinced they&#8217;ve been working on one of the best albums of the year by now, this has definitely done it. _Preparing For Capture_ _2_ is out on on the 4th of September.
