Welcome to the first in a weekly feature here on Lesson Six. It&#8217;s pretty straight forward, a weekly top six of what we&#8217;ve been listening to. It doesn&#8217;t have to be current, it just has to be on the playlist. So let&#8217;s get down to it

<!--more-->

## People Under The Stairs &#8211; Gamin&#8217; On Ya

A rare thing, a track about video games that doesn&#8217;t make you want to cringe. You would expect nothing else from _PUTS_ though.



## Kero One &#8211; Goodbye Forever

With his third album, _Kinetic World_, why not listen to one the better tracks from _Early Believers_?



## Junk Science &#8211; Really, Man

These guys probably don&#8217;t get the recognition they deserve. So, let&#8217;s rectify that, here is the excellent video for Really, Man.



## Dres &#8211; Doin&#8217; It Wrong

Dres of Black Sheep&#8217;s Doin&#8217; It Wrong gets a remix. It&#8217;s far better than the original.



## Grand Analog &#8211; Take It Slow

It&#8217;s tough not to be a good mood after listening to this.



## Jurassic 5 &#8211; Lesson Six

If I didn&#8217;t put this on the first week&#8217;s top six, it would be wrong on so many levels.
  


Come back next Monday for another six.
