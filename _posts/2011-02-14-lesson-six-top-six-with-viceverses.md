That&#8217;s right, the Lesson Six Top Six is back, however, this time with a slight twist &#8211; guest listers. We&#8217;re hoping to get in a plethora of DJs, emcees & musicÂ related people to tell us what they&#8217;ve been listening to over the past few weeks. This week is the turn of Pro Chill from Ohio Hip-Hop group, Viceverses&#8230;

## &#8220;Jay, 50 & Weezy&#8221; by Dee-1

This track is excellent. It features a Dee-1, a very talented emcee speaking directly to three of the more influential mainstream emcees in a very unique way. I love the fact that this dude is from NOLA! With the majority of emcees that fly under the radar hailing from the East Coast, West Coast, and Midwest, it&#8217;s cool to catch a skillful rapper delivering a potent message with that cool Crescent City delivery.



## &#8220;Travelling Man&#8221; by Paulie Rhyme

Paulie Rhyme is a close friend and mentor from Cleveland. He has worked with all kinds of artists including Prince Po and One Be Lo, and he has put together quite a few projects in the past few years. He currently lives in the Bay Area and tours frequently. He makes hip-hop that is soulful, honest, and direct- rhyming comes very natural to him! This track is one of his most popular and it discusses the touring life. Check out his [new project](http://paulierhyme.bandcamp.com/) with another big homie Vic Freeze.



## &#8220;Seek To Know&#8221; by Grand Buffet

If you have never heard Grand Buffet, you are missing out! We actually opened for this Pittsburgh, PA duo in late 2009. Not only were they 2 really down to Earth dudes, they have an excellent and engaging live performance. Their most current work (that I know of) is King Vision, which came out in 2008. It features this track, which displays their indescribable sound and sharp lyrics. These guys truly reside in their own category. Check them out if they tour near you.



## &#8220;Close Your Eyes&#8221; by Jay Electronia & Lucy Liu

I know Jay E is not truly an underground emcee as he hangs out with Diddy, Jay-Z, and T.I. However, he has underground sensibilities and his skill is undeniable. I know this track isn&#8217;t exactly a hip-hop track, It features Lucy Liu speaking over The Bullitts production and singing. As a matter of fact, I&#8217;m still not really sure how to define this song, but, I LOVE IT! This track has the distinction of being the first track in 2011 to give me a chill that ran from the top of my head through my feet. Otherworldly production, haunting Lucy Liu narration, and a gorgeous and inspiring verse from Jay-E make this a track that will always move me to the verge of tears.



## &#8220;Papermill&#8221; by Madvillain

Shout out to Kyle Darrah! I wouldn&#8217;t have known about this track if it weren&#8217;t from him. Being a dedicated DOOM fan, I keep up with my man, but Muser&#8217;s cousin Kyle hipped us to the Adult Swim Singles program during the Summer of &#8217;10. (There is also a Mike Bigga/Flying Lotus collaboration titled &#8220;Swimming&#8221; with Mike Bigga spittin&#8217; over Flying Lotus&#8217; mind blowing instrumental &#8220;Camera Day.&#8221;) DOOM is the greatest emcee ever, in my opinion, and Madvillain is one of the greatest albums EVER. This song showcases the Money Folder rolling on a playful Madlib beat dripping with Indian influence. I&#8217;m so ready for the new Madvillain.



## &#8220;Moonshine&#8221; by Viceverses

I have to big up my crew! We are Viceverses and this is our lone video. Shot by the homie Zeb Zankel, it was filmed at Downtown Crossing in the heart of Boston, MA. When city police asked us what we were doing, we told him we were local students working on an art project &#8211; He told us to have fun and we did. Zeb shot the video in black and white, and then created some color animation to lay over the visuals and although the idea is simple, we really like the result! This track is from our debut album &#8220;Documentary,&#8221; and it&#8217;s just us spitting a few bars over a very unique beat that Muser the DJ whipped up. Citizen Spaid starts off the verse, I take the middle bars, and Muser finishes it up nicely. 3 emcees, 3 different perspectives. Hope you enjoy it!

_And that&#8217;s it for our Top Six this week, join us next week when Junk Science&#8217;s Baje One will be picking the tracks_
