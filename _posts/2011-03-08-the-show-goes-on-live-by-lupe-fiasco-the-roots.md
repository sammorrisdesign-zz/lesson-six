This might look like a bit of a weird one to be posting on a clich√©-free hip-hop blog but Lupe is one of the few mainstream artists to align his principles with ours. Also he&#8217;s got a new album out, one marred in controversy and debate, so it should be something interesting to see unfold over the next few weeks. In the meantime, here is Lupe Fiasco performing &#8220;The Show Goes On&#8221; with The Roots live on Jimmy Fallon.
