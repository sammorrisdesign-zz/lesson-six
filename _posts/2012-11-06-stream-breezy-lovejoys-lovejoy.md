From first hearing Breezy Lovejoy on <a href="http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/08/the-cafeteria-lines-hngry/" target="_blank">HNGRY from the Cafeteria Line</a>, I was hooked by his voice, whether he was rhyming and/or singing. The production on this is also handled by Breezy Lovejoy on most of the tracks, and it really creates the right mixture of a combination of hip-hop, soul and funk.
