Before I get into discussing this song at all, Same Love is the first single from Macklemore & Ryan Lewis&#8217;s upcoming album titled The Heist. This album follows on the success of The VS. EP. Now onto the song, this is a really dope song with some great production from Ryan Lewis. The piano, drums, and the brass sections all blend together perfectly and really set the mood for the song. Macklemore is on point about the subject of marriage equality. I also find it pretty interesting that this is the first single, just a week after the Frank Ocean revelation and release of Channel Orange. Nonetheless, this is a really great song and I can&#8217;t wait for the full album.
