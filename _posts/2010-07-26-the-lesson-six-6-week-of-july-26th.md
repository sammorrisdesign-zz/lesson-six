We&#8217;re just entering our second week. Thanks for the support so far guys, we really appreciate it. As a reward, we&#8217;re going to carry on our weekly features as planned! The 2nd weekly top six is here. Remember, this is what we&#8217;ve been listening to personally and not anything respective of sales or new releases.

## Dumbfoundead x Wax &#8211; I Need A Dollar (Remix)

Let&#8217;s get it started with Dumbfoundead&#8217;s take on Aloe Bacc&#8217;s I Need A Dollar. It&#8217;s probably better than the original&#8230;



## Kero One &#8211; Let Me Clarify

Here&#8217;s one of the better tracks on Kero One&#8217;s schizophrenic Kinetic World. You should read our [review](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/07/kero-ones-kinetic-world-reviewed/). Thanks. Bye.



## Wordburglar &#8211; Cream of Wheat

As far as I can tell, it&#8217;s just porridge but Canadian.



## Abdominal &#8211; Abdominal Workout

With all these D-Sisive posts, I&#8217;ve been reminded of DJ Format and Abdominal. While DJ Format&#8217;s coll-Abs (see what I did there) were good, Abdominal&#8217;s solo stuff seemed kind of ignored in comparison.



## Open Eagle Mike &#8211; I Rock

I probably don&#8217;t listen to enough Open Eagle Mike



## Madvillain &#8211; Papermill

This one&#8217;s a grower.



We&#8217;ll be back next week with another six choices.
