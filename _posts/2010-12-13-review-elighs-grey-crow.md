They say that you have to go through some things before you write great music, it would be tough to argue with that after listening to Grey Crow. With it being the first solo release after triumphing above drug addiction, the album is unsurprisingly personal. These autobiographical tracks spare little detail and really go to great length to sculpt the journey Eligh has been on.

<!--more-->The truth is five years ago, we probably wouldn&#8217;t be featuring an artist like Eligh on Lesson Six. Admittedly, this is because we didn&#8217;t exist then but the point is, Eligh was a very different artist since he tackled his problems with drug addiction head on. Once he dealt with these ongoing personal issues, he was faced with a crossroad in his career. Carry on in the same vein with cliché-ridden rap, give up altogether or attempt to reinvent yourself. After spending a few minutes listening to Eligh&#8217;s first solo album in five years, you&#8217;ll be glad he picked the latter.

Surprisingly, despite taking this new path, Eligh sounds complete at one with himself. He turns to autobiographical storytelling to much acclaim. &#8220;Find Yourself&#8221;, a brilliantly in-depth telling of his entire life in third person and &#8220;Miss Busdriver&#8221; a regaling of the relationship between him and his late aunt, work excellently. These personal tracks easily standout, especially when compared to the rest of the album.

However, it begs the question &#8211; why was such a personal album not kept personal? That&#8217;s not to say that all guest spots don&#8217;t work, just the ones were they border on the clichéd and occasionally directly oppose Eligh&#8217;s new view on drugs. But I must stress that not all of them fall flat. Pigeon John and Inspired Flight make welcome contributions to the album. In fact, [Inspired Flight&#8217;s album](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/07/review-inspired-flights-we-all-want-to-fly/) generally missed the balance between trip-hop vocals and hip-hop lyricism &#8211; here they&#8217;ve nailed the perfect ratio.

> I will never run again and when I am a dad / Put my kids on everything that I could never grab / Teach them how to fight because the world is going mad / Teach them how to love because that&#8217;s all we really have

But this is the reason the latter half of Grey Crow lets down the briliant first impression it makes on you, it&#8217;s full of contradictory and middling guest spots. Eligh, himself, is on top form throughout. His quick fire delivery won&#8217;t wait up as you try to digest it all. Normally this kind of delivery initially hides and then reveals nonsensical lyrics, but here everything Eligh preaches means something. Luckily, Eligh decided to handle most of the production (all but two tracks), so even the production tells the story.

Bizarre and left-field samples by way of Talking Heads and Red Hot Chilli Peppers adds tons to the album. Suitably though, the production works as an extension of Eligh&#8217;s narratives, the way production should be. While the guest spots might detract from the overall theme, the gamble in keeping the production to himself has paid dividends. It&#8217;s just a shame that the other half of the album wasn&#8217;t kept as personal.

Over the course of a listen to the seventeen tracks on Grey Crow, you&#8217;ll realise that it isn&#8217;t perfect. However, like Eligh himself, the flaws make the whole thing distinctly interesting. While it&#8217;s not completely solid throughout, when it&#8217;s good, it&#8217;s a great, deeply personal album that is deserved of your attention, if you&#8217;re willing to give it.
