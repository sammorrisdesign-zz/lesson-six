Raashan Ahmad&#8217;s &#8220;For What You&#8217;ve Lost&#8221; was a strange one for me. At first it seemed like a perfectly steady album with well produced beats and good natured rhymes &#8211; nothing special. But in the past year, the album&#8217;s surprisingly kept its appeal. In fact, I&#8217;ve enjoyed it so much post-review that I&#8217;ve started to feel little guilty for not giving it more of a rave review. Luckily over the last twelve months, Raashan has give me enough excuses to post snippets and videos, but none as good as this one. Here the Crown City Rocker teams up with DJ Moar, as they make &#8220;Just Cool&#8221; even more chilled out than it was before.
