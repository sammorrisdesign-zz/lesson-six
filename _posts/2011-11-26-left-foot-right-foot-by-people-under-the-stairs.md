Thes One & Double K have a knack for making the last handful tracks of their albums brilliant. My one complaint with PUTS is that there is too much focus on quantity but they definitely know how to end an album with fanfare. This, &#8220;Left Foot, Right Foot&#8221; of the freshly pressed Highlighter album, is one of their best finales Â to date. Pure feel good lyrics and production here.
