Seeing as we&#8217;ve spent most of this week plugging a Canadian artist, it would be unfair to have our Canadian love stop at Wordburglar. So here&#8217;s the video for &#8220;Lower Level&#8221; off of Muneshine&#8217;s recently released, and decent, album _There Is Only Today. _Although we haven&#8217;t had a chance to review it, it&#8217;s a great boom-bap album backed with that cliché-free.
