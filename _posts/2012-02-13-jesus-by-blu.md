_j e s u s_ was one of the many releases, prolific rapper Blu, put out last year. In fact I&#8217;m still catching up with a few of his releases last year but this was one I caught. While it was welcomed to a mixed reception there is no denying this track deserved a video. Great soulful production by Madlib combined with a really well shot video should easily redeem that mixtape, for any complaints people had over it.
