_Full Crate_ has dropped a lovely little track for our listening. WARNING: May make you want to drop tools, get an ice cold drink, and chill in the sunshine.

Information from the man himself: _&#8220;Paintings, T-Shits, Mixing Monthly covers &#038; lots of other creative things! I&#8217;m talking about Brian Elstak and his first solo exposition called: Memories of Axel Foley.
  
For this expo he asked several producers to produce a track inspiared by one of the 11 paitings.
  
I got to do the paiting called: Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas.&#8221;_
