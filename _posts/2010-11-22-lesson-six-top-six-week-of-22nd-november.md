Been awhile since I&#8217;ve done one of these. No time to waste then.

## J-Live &#8211; How I Feel Pt.1

We&#8217;ll have a review of Undivided Attention (a preview of S.P.T.A, J-Live&#8217;s full release next year) coming sometime this week. In the meantime, enjoy one of the more conceptually interesting tracks from the EP.



## J. Howells Werthman &#8211; Clich√© (featuring Tone Tank)

A brilliant track off the free J. Howells Werthman release, We Are Making Plans.



## Eligh &#8211; Love of My Life

One of the brilliant tracks from Eligh&#8217;s surprisingly great new album, Grey Crow. Again, review forthcoming.



## Incise &#8211; Your Soul (Ft. Skyrise)

We featured Incise&#8217;s free debut album last week after thoroughly enjoying Incise&#8217;s follow up over the summer. You need to get this well produced free album.



## People Under The Stairs &#8211; Ten Tough Guys

Been spending a stupid amount of time listening to PUTS recently. Lyrically they&#8217;re hit and miss but here they&#8217;re alright. Always laid-back brilliant beats.



## Blame One &#8211; Glass House

One of the first things we featured on this blog. Probably been enough to recycle this decent track.
