_We&#8217;ve just got a few more guestlists to round up our [Best of 2011](http://www.lessonsix.com/category/feature/best-of-2011/) coverage this week. First off, the guy who released our [favourite](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/01/the-best-of-2011-free-downloads-of-the-year/) download of 2011, Milo._

To preface, I&#8217;m hardly a worthwhile musician. More of a clumsy dabbler or something of that sort. I don&#8217;t listen to much in the way of new releases for whatever reason, so what I do listen to tends to be very calculated. Therefore my list will consist mostly of things you probably could have predicted.

## Open Mike Eagle&#8217;s &#8220;Rappers Will Die of Natural Causes&#8221;

This came out over the Summer. I&#8217;m a camp counselor for one week in Wisconsin, at a political science humdinger sort of thing. It&#8217;s a great time. This tape dropped in the middle of that week, and I can&#8217;t say I did anything except listen to it. I remember purposely crafting fables and excuses to drop away from the haps of this camp and listen to this tape. Open Mike is a demi-god of this rap stuff. Check the song &#8220;Dishes&#8221; it&#8217;s the sort of delicious marmalade Studs Terkel would tap dance to.



## Shabazz Palaces&#8217; &#8220;Black Up&#8221;

&#8220;Black Up&#8221; gave me hope. I didn&#8217;t understand it at first. It&#8217;s an album you digest, that overcomes you. That you fall asleep to and wake up the next day trying to imitate Ishmael Butler and you can&#8217;t really recall why &#8216;cos you thought you hadn&#8217;t like that one track with the overly locquatious and long title. Then it envelops you, and you&#8217;re playing it all the time for anyone with ears. This album made me proud to be a human being. As a philosophy major, I dig the discursive nature of Shabazz that runs counter to everything these professors stuff into my head. &#8220;I run off feelings, fuck they facts!&#8221; Stuff like that makes this worthy of so much more writing. I&#8217;ll curtail it though.

## Fleet Foxes&#8217; &#8220;Helplessness Blues&#8221;

Robin Pecknold sang at Kim Jong-Il&#8217;s eulogy. J. Tillman arm wrestled Stone Cold Steve Austin, and although he lost, managed to remain great friends with the man afterwards. Skyler Skjelset bought a lady a baguette once and inside was two tickets to a Susan Lori Parks play, she was overjoyed. Christian Wargo is very kind. Casey Wescott is the white man&#8217;s Ravi Shankar. Morgan Henderson is the obligatory brown man, but more than that, he taught the rest to properly understand Nietzsche as a reactionary to Schopenhauer. This is crucial. Helplessness Blues saved my life. When this album came out, I was very very sad&#8211; all the time. Afterwards, I wasn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s all I can say about it.

## Shut-ins&#8217; &#8220;Underwrought Works&#8221;

The Shut-Ins is the pseudonym or nom de guerre or whatever you call it of a dude named Ed who makes beats on an ancient e-mu machine. He names tracks stuff like, &#8220;The King of Sandwich Island.&#8221; As a lonely person, I can&#8217;t tell you how important it is to actually listen to this release. There&#8217;s this beautiful idea behind the album of expressing humanity and human error through gadgets, gizmos, and electronics. Calculated, off-rhythm bleeps and bloops tunneling all around you but never drifting so far away as to being cerebral. Absolutely beautiful album.



## Serengeti&#8217;s &#8220;Friends and Family &#8220;

Geti King Spaghetti String is a minstrel. I know because I played a minstrel in Lord of the Rings Online. Serengeti&#8217;s tape is wicked. I played &#8220;The Whip&#8221; for my Father over the phone and afterwards he cleared his voice and said, &#8220;Wow. That was a fantastic film.&#8221; Do you understand why that&#8217;s such a great thing to say? Serengeti is the David Lynch of this rap stuff. We need more of that.

## Baths&#8217; &#8220;Pop Music/False B-Sides&#8221;

This isn&#8217;t a proper release or something I read online once made me feel like Baths didn&#8217;t think it was. I don&#8217;t care. Baths is one of 3 producers who has made me cry. I don&#8217;t feel like telling you the other 2. When this tape gets overly self-aware and glitchy it acts as the perfect rise before descending into these stripped down odysseys of sound. When I listen to this release, I sit on my carpet and read old comic books and think about all the cream sodas I&#8217;ve devoured in my life time.



## King Krule&#8217;s &#8220;King Krule EP&#8221;

Without overloading you with philosophical jargon let me say this: what this lad is doing is important. I listen to this EP and I get the sense this kid is super concerned with morality, and ethics and being a generally &#8216;good&#8217; person and girls. These are all the things I think are important, too. Without falling into the typical language traps (see: boredom) when grappling these topics, King Krule turns them into these dreary, dizzy, hazy, drippy, gloopy, loopy, and all those other dwarves&#8217; names, and makes you gyrate in your chair. Factor in that this guy is 17 and I already want to stop making music. I&#8217;ll throw what little internet credence I have to support this guy and his music.

## Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.&#8217;s &#8220;It&#8217;s a Corporate World&#8221;

Sometimes in between reading David Foster Wallace novels, I like to smile. Depressed is certainly my neutral state, but there are times when I have to wipe the tears from my eyes, throw on my crystal moccasins and dance. Such is Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.&#8217;s &#8220;It&#8217;s a corporate World,&#8221; add to the matter that these guys jam in NASCAR racing suits and have a co-sign from Dale Earnhardt Jr. and I need say no more.

## Kurt Elling&#8217;s &#8220;The Gate&#8221;

This is jazz. While &#8220;The Gate&#8221; is a serious departure from my favorite Elling albums (Live in Chicago, Flirting with Twilight) it&#8217;s groovy. The Stevie Wonder redux on this album is devastating! &#8220;The Gate&#8221; has the ability to make you toe tap, and enter an intense Galaxy of Groove.

## Nizm&#8217;s &#8220;A Rapper and a Drummer&#8221;

As a rap guy I try not to listen to much hip hop, especially new stuff, because I&#8217;m afraid of influences and being influenced. This tape straddles the line of being contemporary and old school. There&#8217;s a lot of bounce, and as Nizm let&#8217;s you know this is a record frequently spun at the local skating rink. What most alternative hip hop releases have in an overabundance: existential crisis, this tape lacks and that&#8217;s a serious plus. Put this on Friday night while getting ready / driving to your weekend entertainment and make note of the blueish green aura of absolute cool that will appear around your person. Yeah, Nizm&#8217;s got it like that.
