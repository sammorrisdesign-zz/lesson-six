Homeboy Sandman&#8217;s _First of a Living Breed_ is probably one of the most diverse but most successful albums I&#8217;ve heard in a long time. Every track has unique interesting production, lyrical concepts & even vocal flow. A great case in point, &#8220;Not Really&#8221; features mellow production with a more laid back style that really suits Sandman&#8217;s casual attitude towards becoming famous.
