Before you start wondering why we&#8217;re posting a track called &#8220;Money&#8221;, give it a spin. Rather than glorifying wealth, Jeremiah paints greed as a soulless, and ultimately trivial quest. The accompanying visuals are done by none other than Flying Lotus, his labelmate (and label owner) at Brainfeeder.
