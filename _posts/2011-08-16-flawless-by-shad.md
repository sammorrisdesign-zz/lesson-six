Just in case you don&#8217;t have enough Shad in your life, the Canadian Rapper was recently part of [The New North](http://therealfrequency.bandcamp.com/) compilation of Toronto&#8217;s finest. Despite lacking a few names (Abdominal, anyone?) the album does feature D-Sisive, Kardinal Offishall and this raw sounding track by Shad himself.
