We&#8217;ve been featuring a lot of J-Live over the last few weeks. For a good reason to, his new album SPTA is on the horizon (next year) and the buzz has been building nicely. So far we&#8217;ve just had trickles of one or two track releases at a time but come November the 2nd, we&#8217;ll have a full 6-track EP to feast into.

J-Live&#8217;s &#8220;Undivided Attention&#8221; already sounds interesting with the cover art and release describing a three man team of emcee, deejay and producer (normally all J-Live) having some unresolved issues. It should be interesting and the six tracks should be featuring on the full release next year. Hit the jump for tracklisting.
