An amazing video for Flying Lotus&#8217; new video. I love the 8 bit/computer vibe, from the music to the animation. In fact, this is an open source video, so if you&#8217;re way more intelligent than me and into all that, then go [here](beeple-crap.com/​resources.php) and download the sprites and submit your own videos [here](vimeo.com/​groups/​flyinglotus). Cool, huh?
