Eddie Numbers is a live alternative hip hop band coming out of New Zealand. While the album might have elements of samples and more traditional instrumentation (and what the band&#8217;s name might suggest), they&#8217;re actually a four-piece band of a dummer, vocalist, MC and a guitarist. There&#8217;s something about live groups that seem to force the lyrics into a better place, and Eddie Numbers are no exception.
