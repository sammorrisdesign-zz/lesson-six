Thanks to our friends at [Modern Shark](http://modernshark.com/happy-birthday-kray) we know how that the 10th of March is Kray&#8217;s birthday. Well, we&#8217;ll take any excuse to post some Iller Than Theirs (Kray &#038; Tone Tank) and if we can throw some Cool Calm Pete (at his best, no less) in as well, even better. Here&#8217;s a personal favourite from Iller Than Theirs&#8217; 2007 self-titled album &#8211; the last thing I bought while in America over the summer before the bank cut me off for not telling them I was travelling.

Not sure why you needed that useless piece of information.
