Atmosphere&#8217;s album The Family Sign came out almost a year ago, and a few days ago a video dropped for Became off of the album. This was one of the standout songs on the album, and it fully deserved video treatment especially after watching the video. This is a pretty powerful video really highlighting the imagery and the raps from Slug, accompanied by a powerful beat from Ant.
