Freddie Joachim & Question are back with their fourth vinyl podcast. It has become a seasonal thing, and that means theres more in the future. This one also has a guest, Ohmega Watts who steals the show and rightfully so with the music chosen. Also get some information on new works by all three of the artists, which is great to hear.
