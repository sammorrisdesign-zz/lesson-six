Friends of the site and all round great publication, The Find Magazine, have taken the step from online pdfs to the printing press. Issue four of The Find Magazine is now [available](http://thefindmag.com/?p=5855) to buy and it&#8217;s wholly recommendable. Great features, interviews and a few select choices from 2010. It&#8217;s really good to see something on our genre in printed form.

Makes wonder what a Lesson Six magazine would look like&#8230;
