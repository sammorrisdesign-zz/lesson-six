We&#8217;ve had Wordburglar&#8217;s third album, appropriately titled _3rdburglar_, on our list of upcoming albums for a long time now &#8211; we were starting to get worried. Luckily though, he&#8217;s recently released his first single from this long-awaited album. &#8220;Rhyme O&#8217;Clock&#8221; is pure hip-hop through and through as Wordburglar &#038; More or Les pass the mic back and forth. The latest date on the album is set for May 2012.
