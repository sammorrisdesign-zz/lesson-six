Strangely enough, I&#8217;ve never listened to much _Ty_, which is actually annoying since he has four albums and he&#8217;s worked with some big name artists. Nutty P&#8217;s Stinkhabell remix, which you can listen to on [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/3GgVyX7R6kWVqf5ej2gSZg), was featured on one of _Soccer AM&#8217;s_ clips. I would have featured that but for once, Youtube has let me down and pleasantly enough, the original is even better, with a great laid-back sample that constantly plays throughout and some cleverly positive lyrics from _Ty_.
