As we revealed in our early 2011 [release list](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/01/on-the-horizon-2011/), a new Ugly Duckling album is on the way. We know now that &#8220;Moving At Breakneck Speed&#8221; is definitely coming out sometime this year, with a concrete release date yet to be announced. We also know the name of three of the tracks, Keep Movinâ€™, Elevation and Sprint. Unfortunately the information stops there.

However, in order to wet our appetite a little, they&#8217;ve released a rare track from their last album. Audacity Pt.3 featuring Pigeon John is now available [for free](http://www.pledgemusic.com/widgets/809). Get it now.
