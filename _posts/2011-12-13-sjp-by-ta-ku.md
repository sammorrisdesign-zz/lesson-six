I&#8217;m not normally a massive fan of futurebeats but catch me in the right mood like Teebs & Eloquent did, and I&#8217;ll show some love. Here is Ta-Ku, from the same stable of artists as Eloquent, the Australian definitely caught me at the right time. Here&#8217;s &#8220;SJP&#8221; off his new release LateNYC, of which you can listen to more [here](http://ta-ku.me/album/latenyc).
