Long time followers of the blog will probably be aware of our, frankly, fanboy love for the guys over at Modern Shark. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re giving you a nudge, and showing our support, for the Bi-Polar Bear project going on over at Kickstarter. Their new album, entitled &#8220;When Ledge Is Home&#8221; features guest spots by Junk Science &#038; Blue Sky Black Death and has already reached it&#8217;s goal in funding. But you know how these things go, you give a little, you get a lot (and a warm feeling of pledging towards dope projects like this) so the more funding they get the better it is for everyone. So watch the charismatic video above and jump over to the [project page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/516856232/bi-polar-bear-when-ledge-is-home) on Kickstarter.
