J-Live&#8217;s _S.P.T.A._ was easily one of the best albums of last year. Groundbreaking it wasn&#8217;t, but J-Lives innate ability to make a beat &#8211; and rap about just about anything while keeping your attention &#8211; elevated it to one of the best releases of last year. Here he revisited the intro track &#8220;As I Start&#8221; and brings everyone up to speed on recent developments. J-Live&#8217;s near 20 year spanning career has probably left him with no shortage of tracks to tour for a few years, but let&#8217;s hope he gets back in the booth for more soon.
