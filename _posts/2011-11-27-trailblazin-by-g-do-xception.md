G-do & Xception are criminally slept on. These guys first burst on the scene with Felatastic, a tribute to Fela Kuti which was a really great effort. Just recently I found out that a new album was in the works and is almost ready for release. The first single off the album Sankofa(<a href="http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/307761_312990475379734_129050400440410_1299458_885037715_n.jpg" target="_blank">album art is pretty sick too</a>) Trailblazin was released a while back. The video is pretty sweet and the message is really positive.
