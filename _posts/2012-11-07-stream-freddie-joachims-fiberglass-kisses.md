The one album I&#8217;ve really been waiting for since first hearing about it back in the spring. This album sounds great, and shows an evolution from some of the earlier work of Freddie Joachim. This is more than anything a soulful r&b album, consisting of some great production and great vocalists like Mar, Lauren Santiago and more.
