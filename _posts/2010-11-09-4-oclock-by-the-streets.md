Maybe for those across the pond an Essentials article for The Streets would be a good idea. Anyway, Mike Skinner is back for his final album under The Streets banner. _Computers and Blues_ is due out February next year and sounds like a return to his earlier stuff which is easily miles better than the last two releases.
