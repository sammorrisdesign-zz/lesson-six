Appropriately, Ugly Duckling have just released a tongue-in-cheek video for &#8220;Elevation&#8221; from their brilliant 2011 album _Moving At Breakneck Speed_. Animating the artwork, call backs to previous Yudee covers &#038; the odd guest spot from a comedian or two. The Long Beach trio have definitely done this track the justice it deserves.
