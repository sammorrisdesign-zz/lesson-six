## Around The Site

_What we&#8217;ve been up to on Lesson Six_

This month we hit on reviews of producer duo, The Funk League&#8217;s boom bap masterclass, [Funky as Usual](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/review-the-funk-leagues-funky-as-usual/) & Audible Mainframe&#8217;s applaudable attempt to raise money for charity in [Victory Sessions Vol. 1](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/audible-mainframes-victory-sessions-vol-1/). We gave a [jumping off point](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/essentials-dj-format/) for any unfamiliar with UK turntable wizard, DJ Format, before his new album dropped in our first [Essentials](http://www.lessonsix.com/category/feature/essentials) of the year. Finally, we got around to polishing off our Best of 2012 coverage in the form of [Milo](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/the-best-of-2011-milos-albums-of-the-year/) & [our&#8217;s](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/the-best-of-2011-albums-of-the-year/) album&#8217;s of the year. Introductions were made for [Jae Fresh](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/introducing-jae-fresh/) & [MOEdavey](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/introducing-moedavey/). Finally, our columnist Kwes covered the topics of [writing about female MCs](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/letters-from-the-front-the-looming-problems-of-writing-about-female-emcees/) & [Horrorcore](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/letters-from-the-front-concerning-the-gravediggaz-odd-future-horrorcore/), in more Letters From The Front.
