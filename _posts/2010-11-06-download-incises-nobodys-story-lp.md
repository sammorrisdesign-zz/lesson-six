Back in August I splurged for five paragraphs on how I wish I had found Incise&#8217;s Daily Methods at the beginning of the summer. I didn&#8217;t, but that didn&#8217;t stop it becoming my late soundtrack to the summer. Anyway, the point is Incise is a very good producer, and apparently he&#8217;s also a very nice guy since he&#8217;s just released his first album for free &#8211; with four extra tracks to boot.

I haven&#8217;t listened to Nobody&#8217;s Story yet but it&#8217;s free, his last album was brilliant and it&#8217;s free. Did I mention it&#8217;s free?
