One thing that we avoid here on this site is posting overtly cliched hip-hop music, and its pretty safe to say that while Kanye does have his moments, his music is the type you wouldn&#8217;t really find on this site. N*\*\\*\*s in Poorest is a reinterperation of the popular Kanye and Jay-Z song N\*\***s in Paris. On this track Yasiin Bey reworks the song using the same production, but adding in lyrics that are socially insightful. The video is great as well, as images from different movies, events, and protests are woven through out Yasiin Bey rapping his version of the song.
