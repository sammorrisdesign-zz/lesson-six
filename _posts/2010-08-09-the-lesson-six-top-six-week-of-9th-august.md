Another Monday, another six choices from the Lesson Six playlist. If you&#8217;re new to the site, every Monday we post six tracks we&#8217;ve been listening too recently. Now this doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re new, in fact it normally means the opposite, but they&#8217;re all decent.

## Jazsapiens &#8211; Starving Artists (feat. Dumbfoundead)

So good, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that it&#8217;s available for [free](http://aero-k.bandcamp.com/album/elevator-music).



## DJ Format &#8211; Three Feet Deep (Feat Abdominal & D-Sisive)

One from back in the day here. It&#8217;s crazy to think what&#8217;s happened to these artists since this.



## Inspired Flight &#8211; Push, Pull, Let Go (Feat. Eligh)

I know I gave this a [middling review](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/07/review-inspired-flights-we-all-want-to-fly/), but when it was good, it was brilliant. Here&#8217;s one of the better tracks from the album.



## Kero One &#8211; Check The Blueprints (Japan 12&#8243; Remix)

Last week was the first Top Six that didn&#8217;t have any Kero One. Sorry about that.



## The Disablists & Foreign Beggars &#8211; Heavy Rotation

Sometimes I want to supplement a video with something insightful about it. Sometimes I fail. Here&#8217;s another good track.



## Shad &#8211; The Old Prince Still Lives At Home

Another instant classic. We&#8217;re probably mentioning Shad too many times to be legal. It&#8217;s ok, restraining orders only mention distance, right?
