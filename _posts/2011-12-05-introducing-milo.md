A few weeks back I got an email that at one point read &#8220;I feel hip-hop has betrayed it&#8217;s nerdier fanbase&#8221;. One listen to Milo&#8217;s, criminally good for a 1st mixtape release, &#8220;I Wish My Brother Rob Was Here&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find it tough to argue. So many quotables, clearly made points and well procured beats meant that it&#8217;s easily my contender for free download of the year, impressive for what is Milo&#8217;s first release. But just incase you didn&#8217;t get a sense of the man himself, which is tough considering how genuine he comes across, we asked him those important six questions.

## **Who?**

In one sentence I am Rory. In another I am Milo.

## **Where?**

The North Woods of Wisconsin. Put up your left hand. The place between your thumb and index finger is where I&#8217;ve set up the Owl Farm.

## **When?**

To be totally honest, I haven&#8217;t started yet. Right now I write a lot of words down that aren&#8217;t particularly musical in any way. I barely keep them on beat. I&#8217;m getting there, though.

## **What?**

On Tuesday, November 1st I will release my first mixtape titled, &#8220;I wish my brother Rob was here.&#8221; I plan on a little hiatus and jumping back into things with an EP from a band I am in, as well as another Milo mixtape. Sometime next year, I&#8217;ll try to put out an album. That takes a lot more discipline and talent than I have currently at my disposal.

## **Why?**

This mixtape is specifically made for the left over screws when you built your TV stand. The people who never had anything to relate to when they listened to hip hop, or logged on Tumblr and saw only atrociously chiseled good looking people, or got on Twitter and announced boldly to their 3 followers that today was a GREAT DAY. Even more specifically than that these songs I write are for my friend Rob, who doesn&#8217;t live here anymore.

## **How?**

My studio, which is my bedroom here at school, is called the Owl Farm. Normally the process starts there, upon my perch I ponder pedantically about all the little terrible things that have made me want to flush my I-faculty down the toilet. I like to jostle these thoughts around in my mind, specifically things like, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t that very smart girl acknowledge my existence?&#8221; &#8220;Does my favorite professor think I&#8217;m a boob?&#8221; &#8220;How am I going to pay off the remainder of my tuition so as to register for classes in a timely fashion?&#8221; These kinds of thoughts are then promptly harvested for their self-pitying qualities and blended with over-the-top rhetoric and arrhythmia which is when the entire concentrated smoothie blend is distributed through your local speaker system, and red solo cup string-line telephonic device.
