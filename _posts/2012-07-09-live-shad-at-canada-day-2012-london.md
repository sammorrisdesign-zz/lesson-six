At a packed Trafalgar Square, the crowd were ready to receive the next Canadian act to celebrate their national day with, on stepped the modest emcee from London, Toronto. Playing at these variety mini-festivals is always a tough ask but there where enough people won over with Shad&#8217;s rock-rap tracks to appeal.

He stuck to mainly newer material with &#8220;Rose Garden&#8221;, &#8220;A Good Name&#8221;, &#8220;We Myself & I&#8221;, &#8220;Yaa I Get It&#8221;, &#8220;Keep Shining&#8221; & &#8220;Compromise&#8221; all making appearances in a short but crammed set.

While he played no new material, he did freestyle in double time to The Cure&#8217;s &#8220;Close To Me&#8221;. We caught up with him after he played his set to learn of a new album coming sometime next year.
