A little late on this, but its better late than never. RAS is looking for support for their upcoming album entitled Flip The Script, and you can help them out and get some cool stuff in return on the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jbroandtiger/flip-the-script-0" target="_blank">kickstarter</a> page. I am really looking forward to this album and with about 1 week left, they need all the help they can get.
