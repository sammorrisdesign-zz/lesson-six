After listening to [yesterday&#8217;s](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/01/my-oh-my-by-macklemore-ryan-lewis/) Macklemore & Ryan Lewis release of their Dave Niehaus tribute, I prompty went back and got their free release, [The VS. EP](http://ryanlewis.bandcamp.com/album/the-vs-ep). Quite honestly I was blown away by the final track, luckily I listened to it first for some reason, as it&#8217;s easily the best track on the EP. The rest is a mix of interesting and clich√©d guest appearences. However, this track deserves your attention.
