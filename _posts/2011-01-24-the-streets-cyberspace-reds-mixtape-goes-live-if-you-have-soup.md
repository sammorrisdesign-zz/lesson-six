There&#8217;s a slight technicality to this post though. If you want to get your hands on the mixtape of Mike Skinner&#8217;s latest (excluding the upcoming album, Computers and Blues) you&#8217;ll have to turn your phone into a barcode scanner. Go the app store and get the [Mike Scanner](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mike-scanner/id415355534?mt=8) app. Once you&#8217;ve done that you need two barcodes. One can be found onÂ [The Streets website](http://the-streets.co.uk/2011/01/cyberspace-and-red-soup/) while the other can be found on a 300g can of Heniz tomato soup. Luckily I had a can of the stuff in.

I could be an arse and post the link here but that would take the fun out of [it](http://bln.kr/-cyberspace_and_reds/).
