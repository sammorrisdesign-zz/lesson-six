&#8220;I want some chicken&#8221;

Stonesthrow and Homeboy Sandman is pretty much the perfect match. Personally, that combination has helped make one of my favourite albums of the year. &#8220;Whatchu Want From Me&#8221; is Homeboy proving that he can rap early on in the album, before he slows it down and gets more or less serious later on.
