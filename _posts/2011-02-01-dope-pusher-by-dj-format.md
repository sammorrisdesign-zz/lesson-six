Well this was a pleasant surprise if there ever was one. UK&#8217;s own DJ Format, producer who gave starts to D-Sisive, Abdominal while also working with members of Jurassic 5, has released new material in &#8220;Dope Pusher/Here Comes The Dope Pusher&#8221;. Big Daddy Kane samples & a distinctly old school feel means this is all we could have wished for and more. You should probably check out the [instrumental B-side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKnD-jl2U8&feature=player_embedded#) while you&#8217;re at it as well.

It&#8217;s been publicised that he&#8217;s been working on a 3rd album for a long time now, could this be a sign of things to come? It has been six long years since we last laid ears into a new DJ Format solo album, let&#8217;s hope that changes soon.
