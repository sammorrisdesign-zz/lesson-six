It seems only yesterday that we had a [double EP](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/10/review-atmospheres-to-all-my-friends-ep/) (essentially a full album) by Minnesota&#8217;s finest. Yet, here we are a month in 2011 and we&#8217;ve got a newly dated album by way of Atmosphere. &#8220;The Family Signs&#8221; will be out on the 12th of April (my birthday, if you&#8217;re thinking of getting me anything). They&#8217;ve already &#8216;leaked&#8217; the first track, entitled Minnesota Nice. Download it [here](http://www.usershare.net/wmy2h0nyofqq).
