We&#8217;re only five years late on this one. Frequent collaborators with _Kero One_, _The Sound Providers_ have always been one of those great producer duos that I&#8217;ve always been meaning to check out. It&#8217;s now difficult to check out other artists after spending the past two weeks listening to them and Florida based MC, _Surreal_ on _True Indeed_. It&#8217;s just a shame that I can&#8217;t find much else past that 2006 release. Here&#8217;s hoping that a follow up is cooking in the lab. While you wait though, go back and check out this tribute to jazz hip-hop.
