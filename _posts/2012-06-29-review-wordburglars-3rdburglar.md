Rap has had some pretty groanworthy lines over the years and &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you out of the ring, like your ex-wife&#8217;s finger&#8221; or &#8220;I love rap like a falafel in a pita bun&#8221; would surely rank high in anyone&#8217;s list of them. But on his 3rd album, aptly titled 3rdburglar, the Canadian underground rapper Wordburglar takes such a liberal approach to these kind of similes and delivers them at such a relentless pace, that it&#8217;s hard not to become infatuated.

Like a one-man, nerdier, Ugly Duckling, he brings outright fun and high energy to a unique brand of hip-hop. Wordburglar&#8217;s personality has always been his strength, always willing to share issues or get deep into comic book and nerd culture references without resorting to parody. In fact, he even dedicates a few tracks to just calling out comic books (&#8220;Drawing With Words&#8221;) or video games (&#8220;Yabosayo&#8221;) to good effect with only &#8220;Dude, Where&#8217;s My AT-AT at?&#8221; wearing thin after a couple of rotations.

> Now back to cool stuff like sports bloopers / and Star Wars when Han and Luke were Stormtroopers / I love rap like a falafel in a pita bun / Optimus Prime&#8217;s girlfriend is Elita One

But, unusually when compared to his previous albums, &#8216;burg seems more at home on the less-conceptual tracks. &#8220;Sufficiently Suffonsified&#8221; crams seemingly endless amounts of wordplay in its three and a half minutes while &#8220;Croque Monsieur&#8221; sets a similar tone in the album&#8217;s opener. Although the stand-out comes from the back-and-forth with More or Les on &#8220;Rhyme O&#8217;Clock&#8221;, here the duo bring high amounts of energy to a track that&#8217;s unashamedly hip-hop.

Wordburglar&#8217;s previous releases have hinted at something greater, and 3rdburglar bests them with an album packed full of references, similes and laughs. It won&#8217;t be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea, but anyone who likes goofy in their hip-hop you should find one of their albums of the year in 3rdburglar.
