Lupe is definitely back. After his is disappointing 3rd album &#8211; although not through any fault of his own &#8211; _Lasers_, Lupe has been prepping his return in _Food &#038; Liquor 2: The Great American Rap Album Pt.1_. Now that the whole Pete Rock stuff has died down, he&#8217;s just released visuals for the return-to-form single &#8220;Around My Way&#8221;.
