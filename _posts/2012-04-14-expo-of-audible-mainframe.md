Sad news on this front, Expo the lead MC of Audible Mainframe passed away a couple days ago from cancer. Over the past few years, I have really enjoyed listening to Expo rhyme from his solo efforts to the group efforts with Mainframe. His rhymes were and are super dope and he always told it like it is. Just a couple months ago, I had a chance to do an advance review of VICtory Sessions, Vol. 1 from Audible Mainframe, and those songs featured the excitement that Expo and Audible Mainframe had.
