Our favourite genre-justifying nerd rapper, Milo, has left us waiting for the follow up, to the excellent _I Wish My Brother Rob Was Here,_ ever since we finished listening to &#8220;Bill Murray&#8217;s Prayer&#8221;. His 2nd mixtape, using production by Baths, is appropriately titled _Milo Takes Baths_ has just seen the light of day. Milo takes his autobiographical lyrics to an entirely new level here, picking excellently curated beats by Anitcon&#8217;s Baths. There is a reason we gave Milo&#8217;s last mixtape such [high praise](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/01/the-best-of-2011-free-downloads-of-the-year/) and yet _Milo Takes Baths_ somehow manages to live up to that high bar. Just download it already.
