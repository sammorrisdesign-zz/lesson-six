In case you haven&#8217;t realised summer is here. Long followers of the blog might remember that this time last year, we released a Soundtrack To The Summer soundcloud and we&#8217;re looking to do the same. Needless to say, this is probably going on it. Off Blitz&#8217;s recent release called Native Sun, the title track is five and half minutes of pure summer relaxation. It&#8217;s also another excuse to post some Shad on this site.
