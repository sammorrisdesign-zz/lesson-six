Doing anything for the next five minutes? You should probably spare it for this.

It&#8217;s good to see Macklemore get the attention he deserves recently. He&#8217;s genuinely trying to do something different, with meaning, and is doing a great job with it. If you&#8217;re the only person reading this blog who is new to Macklemore, that&#8217;s something you might want to [address](http://www.lessonsix.com/?s=macklemore). With a full album on the way soon, he&#8217;s only going to get bigger.
