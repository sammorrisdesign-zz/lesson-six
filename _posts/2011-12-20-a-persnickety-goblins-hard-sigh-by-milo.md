I&#8217;ve spent a majority of the last few weeks listening to Milo&#8217;s recently released mixtape &#8220;I Wish My Brother Rob was Here&#8221;. Despite only being 19 years old, Milo seems very fluent and well thought out when on the mic. We&#8217;ve recently had a chance to [sit down and talk](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/12/introducing-milo/) with Milo as a new up and coming artist, to learn a little bit about him.
