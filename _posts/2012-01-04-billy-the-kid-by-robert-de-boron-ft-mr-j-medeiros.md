Robert De Boron is an up and coming producer, and on this song Mr. J Medeiros raps over a very smooth jazzy beat. Take a listen to the song and read Mr. J Medeiros&#8217;s explanation below

The premise of the story is “The Pen is Mightier” and it follows a man through three stages of his life. Here is a very brief explanation, only c&#8230;overing the general ideas.

STAGE 1: At first he is a boy obsessed with toy guns (war games, G.I. Joe’s, Rambo, the Mafia, car chases, etc.) and following his imagination. I feel at this stage in his life the “Pen” and the “Sword” are one, he is physically inside his imagination- he is “writing” and “fighting” at the same time.

(…even when eating he needed his G.I. Joe’s, by his side, guarding his pride, a soldier or a poet it got harder to decide.)

STAGE 2: He is in his teens, hes battle to understand whether the “Pen is Mightier” has consumed his thought life, taking more of an existentialist perspective this time around. He reads, studies, and asks himself contrasting questions- so much that he is barely paying attention to the “present”, and thus looses his job.

(…the difference between Martin and Malcom he couldn’t see it in the outcome, they didn’t live to see it, now how come?)

STAGE 3: He joins the military, living out the reality of his childhood imagination and still caught between wanting to be a “writer” and wanting to be a “fighter”. I get the impression whether he knew or not, he was going to do both anyway. He dies in battle, he lives behind his writings for his son, and the song ends with this idea…

(…was it the words from his hands, or the bullet from a gun, who kept a man alive for his son.)

I hope there is more to this song then what was just explained. Maybe the interweaving lines about man’s fragile ego, or the contradiction between the authors mentioned, or the idea that the man did both “write” and “fight”- can conjure up conversation. In my opinion though, yes- the “Pen is Mightier”…when it has something to write about.
