posthumous album released by Hydeout Records with many features including Cise Star, Substantial, and Pase rock plus more. A great effort and serves as a nice tribute.

After a brief break where no news really came out from Cyne, The Wasteland is being released as a mixtape on casette. Looks like this is going to be a great tape with the first two tracks from Cise Star and Enoch being leaked.

and much more so stay tuned.
