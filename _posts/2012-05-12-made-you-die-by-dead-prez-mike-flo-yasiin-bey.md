Made You Die is a tribute song for Trayvon Martin, who was killed earlier this year. This song is easily one of the better tribute songs that has come out to highlight the issues that the death of Trayvon Martin brought to the forefront. It contains a very powerful message accompanied by some great visuals as well.
