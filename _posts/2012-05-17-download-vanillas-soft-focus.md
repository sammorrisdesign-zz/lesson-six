[This time last year](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/05/download-vanillas-high-life/) UK Producer, Vanilla, dropped one of the best beattapes of 2011. It turns out lightning does strike twice, Vanilla just released [_Soft Focus_](http://vanillabeats.bandcamp.com/) and initial thoughts, it&#8217;s everything as good as last year&#8217;s _High Life_. I&#8217;m ready for him to team up with some rappers now, could be on for something special.
