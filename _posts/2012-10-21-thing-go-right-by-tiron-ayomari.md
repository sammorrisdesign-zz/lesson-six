Another video from TiRon & Ayomari&#8217;s A Sucker for Pumps, and this one does not dissapoint. This is a great concept and pretty impressive visuals. It may be a little confusing to figure out what is actually going on and what the message is, so heres a little explanation:

> This video was inspired by the concept of people being in relationships they don’t want to be in.  Holding their breath and biting their tongue instead of venting their frustrations….and eventually it all erupts and spills out.  The relationships underwater are relationships built on dishonesty and secrecy in regards to their true feelings and emotions.  Bottom line, if you’re in a relationship you don’t want to be in and you’re not speaking up…its time to get out of the water.
