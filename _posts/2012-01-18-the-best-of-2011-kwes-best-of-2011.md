## Dream Jefferson &#8211; Punch Perm

Full disclosure &#8211; Owel Five is my brother and I released an album produced by Corboe. That out of the way, this is an incredible album. To label Dream Jefferson with any kind of identifying term or to put them into any genre&#8217;s box is to do the sound an injustice, because this is wholly original. There are obvious influences, but this is not an exercise in half-baked throwback attempts or an attempt at genre-bending. It serves as an evolutionary leap in progression from their debut, Sasquatch Bury Their Dead, and if you&#8217;re familiar with that EP, that should speak volumes.

## Flight Distance &#8211; Bad Information

While thinking through how to best describe this album, I couldn&#8217;t help but think &#8220;Cormac McCarthy meets Illmatic&#8221;, but I as this is an anti-cliche blog, I decided against the &#8220;(x) meets (y)&#8221; pseudo-description and &#8220;referring to any hip hop album as (Artist/Group)&#8217;s Illmatic&#8221;. The Cormac McCarthy reference could be considered lazy, as the group open the album with a quote from Blood Meridian (also, I believe they would say they are bigger fans of Bukowski). Also I considered what I had just said about the labelling and boxing of an artist or group doing a great disservice, so I was left with nothing to say but that this is an incredible album.

## Vektrx &#8211; Devil Music

Are we starting to see a pattern here? Yes, so far all of these albums are by Canadian emcees, specifically, Ottawa emcees. Vektrx is a vet in the Ottawa scene and released this LP over the span of roughly 3 months, week-by-week, each track with its own art. The production is raw with some beats sounding like post-modern Eric B, the delivery equally-so and bellicose, and the content dark. Shit bangs, too.

## OG Hindu Kush &#8211; In 3-D

Osa and Loe Pesci hail from Ottawa and Montreal respectively. Seeing as Dumbfounddead took the top track of the year on this very site, I don&#8217;t think it would be too presumptuous to assume that readers would also be familiar with his battle career, and by extension, have most likely heard either of those names. Perhaps some of the lyrical content may strike some as cliche (given this site&#8217;s motto), but my views on what may or may not be considered cliche in hip hop are nuanced, if not complicated. But we&#8217;re not talking apples and apples if that&#8217;s where this conversation is going. You&#8217;re talking Kia&#8217;s and I&#8217;m talking about the goddamn Batmobile. The production features some of Montreal&#8217;s finest and Ottawa&#8217;s Crack Moses who was also responsible for the production on Bad Information.

## Ill O&#8217;Reilly &#8211; Butterfly Switch Bladerunner

My album produced by Corboe. I know, shameless. We worked on these tracks between 2008-10, and every track was recorded in a different bedroom studio. Darker in sound than either of our other projects, its tied together by samples of various writers. Colour me biased, but I think it&#8217;s swell.

We&#8217;ll be back with more tomorrow.
