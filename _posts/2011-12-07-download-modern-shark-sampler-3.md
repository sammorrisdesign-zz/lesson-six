Over the past year, one of our favourite labels, Modern Shark have been putting out free samplers packed with tracks from top artists like Junk Science, Serengeti, Cool Calm Pete and more. [Number three](modernshark.bandcamp.com/album/modern-shark-sampler-tape-number-three) is here, and it&#8217;s probably the pick of the bunch. If you like your rap strange but well produced, this is one you won&#8217;t want to miss.
