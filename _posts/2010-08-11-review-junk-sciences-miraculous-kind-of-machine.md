Critics have a pretty tough job. Sure from the outside it seems like it&#8217;s all review copies and event invites but editorially tough decisions have to be made. You see, I have this theory that most journalists eventually become tired of their medium. Handing out average scores to releases that are half decent and greatly rewarding anything that&#8217;s remotely unique or different in anyway.

<!--more-->I bring up this theory to make a tenuous link between it and 

_Junk Science&#8217;s_ third album, _A Miraculous Kind of Machine_. Admittedly _Junk Science_ are, at their core, still hip-hop. However, only as in they sound like someone rhythmically talking over produced music. With that said they definitely aren&#8217;t cut from the same cloth as most. Weird slow-downed samples play over airy synthesised noises between tracks and the tracks themselves are anything but mainstream. You&#8217;ll be taken back and anyone new to the duo of _Baje One_ and _Snafu_ will more than likely wonder what all the buzz is about.

> If you can&#8217;t relate to what I say, or don&#8217;t like the way I say it / Then it&#8217;s probably safe to say that you don&#8217;t like me as a rapper

Then once you start to dissect _A Miraculous Kind of Machine,_ you start to appreciate how different it is &#8211; like a critic would. They don&#8217;t try to hide it, the album&#8217;s stand-out track &#8220;Fire Drill&#8221; makes no apologies in terms of lyrics or production. It only dips further into the left-field throughout the album, tracks like &#8220;Sailing&#8221; and &#8220;First Snow&#8221; experiment with every aspect of the art-form. Then again, for every &#8220;Sailing&#8221; there are two &#8220;Really, Man&#8221; or &#8220;Running Shoes&#8221; &#8211; more accessible tracks that look into subjects like financial security and growing older.

It&#8217;s an eclectic mix of tracks, that&#8217;s for sure, but once you&#8217;ve gotten over the initial hurdle you&#8217;ll find insightful and humorous lyrics over exceptionally unique production. However, with that said the term acquired taste will never apply to an artist more aptly. _A Miraculous Kind of Machine_ deserves a listen but it isn&#8217;t for everyone and is probably the least accessible of their three albums to date. Anyone new would probably be better off starting with _Grandad&#8217;s Nerve Tonic_ before moving onto this, anyone else will not be disappointed. Personally though, I&#8217;m probably not enough of a critic to _completely_ love it but I&#8217;m not too far away.
