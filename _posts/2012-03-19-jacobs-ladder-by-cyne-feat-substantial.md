So new Cyne is always appreciated, but this track is one that I can tell will be on repeat for a while. Jacob&#8217;s Ladder is a track released from a compilation titled Project: Mooncircle that their label released. The entire compilation is full of super dope tracks and you can order the entire thing <a href="http://www.hhv.de/item_266737.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Getting back to Cyne&#8217;s track though, the production by Speck and Enoch are superb, and Cise Star and Substantial add a really nice flow to the track. Take a listen and support the entire project.
