About a week ago we made a rare post that featured a UK artist. It&#8217;s something that we need to fix considering most of us are from the UK and that&#8217;s why we got in touch with Jae Fresh. Unlike the bulk of UK artists that call themselves rappers, this one isn&#8217;t a grime artist, opting for laidback jazz-laden beats rather than overly bassy sounding synths. So we decided he should be allowed to introduce himself by asking him six specific questions.

<!--more-->

## Who?

I go by the name of Jae Fresh and I am an all round music lover.

## Where?

Brighton, born and bred. 

## When?

I started emceeing at around 13 I&#8217;d say, but started to produce around 15. I&#8217;ve got a couple of my old tracks from then, but they will never ever see the light of day!

## What?

I&#8217;m always working on something, I&#8217;ve got so many beat tapes, eps and shit that I was once going to put out into the public domain, but like everything I get bored and is now kept in the vault. At the moment I&#8217;m working on a ep that kind of sums up &#8216;I Need a Coffee&#8217; then I&#8217;ve a beat tape/ep called &#8216;Sweat&#8217; that I hope to bring out. Also another album which is moving a bit away from Jazz and having a more contemporary feel to it. I get bored doing the same type of shit over and over, we all need to switch it up.

## Why?

Because I love it, the whole process when creating a feeling, a vibe and how certain sounds can take you back to a time or a memory, its one of the greatest experiences. 

## How?

The Nag Champa has to be lit, MPC1000, Stacks of vinyl, Macbook, a midi keyboard and what ever is laying about. And as of when it comes to recording a cold bottle of beer with some water. Just me and the engineer, oh and of course the Nag Champa will be lit.
