DJ Nu-Mark&#8217;s Broken Sunlight series, now in it&#8217;s third release of the year, has gotten better with each release. The 2nd one included great tracks with Tiron & Ayomari and J-Live, was always going to be a hard one to top. But with the 3rd release, Nu-Mark has switched it up with a more soulful sounding release on &#8220;Our Generation&#8221;, enlisting the help of R&B singer Ernie Hines. On the flip side he gets a bit more experimental with &#8220;The Fever&#8221;, including a little bit of wobble bass, and it&#8217;s definitely the weaker of the two tracks. But it&#8217;s another DJ Nu-Mark release that&#8217;s worth getting.
