It&#8217;s hard to believe but it&#8217;s been a year to the day that we heard the news that Guru of Gang Starr passed away. With us being in our relative youth as a website, we were unable to pay homage to a true classic. While we can&#8217;t enjoy his later work, when in his prime, he was the best in his class. Him and Premo were the true innovators of jazz rap and the whole community will be forever grateful for that. So let&#8217;s listen to Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal do what he does best.
