Calling yourself Vanilla is just going to encourage critics to engage in a bit of offhanded punnery. Then again I never found the flavour bland or boring and the same could be said for Vanilla&#8217;s (the producer) free beat-tape entitled &#8220;High Life&#8221;. I would love to hear someone over the top of these, a great sound for those summer BBQs.

It&#8217;s free if you visit the [Bandcamp](http://vanillabeats.bandcamp.com/album/high-life) and get the [Mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/?sm23jcs7q8tiyxl) link at the bottom. Apparently free downloads can expire on Bandcamp?
