After months of hearing nothing about any new music from One Be Lo, the past few weeks have been filled with new releases. First there was the Laborhood parts 1 and 2 mixtapes, which led up to the release of LABOR. 21 tracks strong, LABOR is an album that was well worth the wait. It is very evident that Lo put a lot of effort into this album. From opening with Laborhood to the ending with Wildebeest, every track is filled with catchy wordplay, and slick rhymes. This is an album that you have to listen to just to witness the &#8220;Labor&#8221; One Be Lo put into it.

On a side note this album is a prelude to his next release entitled BABY, which comes out in 9 months.
