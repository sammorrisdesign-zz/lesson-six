I think it is safe to say that Lasers was not what we expected from Lupe. His previous albums showcased his ability to blend the serious with the fun. This is a follow up mixtape to <a href="http://limelinx.com/files/17a30d5e05a131f9cb5c8b0e31f2eecf" target="_blank">Enemy of the State</a> which came out last year. Enemy of the State and Friend of the People are both great mixtapes because Lupe is not bound by a label or anyone else. This is just his raw emotions and thinking so take a listen and download it if you like it.
