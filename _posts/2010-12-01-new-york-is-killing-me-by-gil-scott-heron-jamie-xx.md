Quite an interesting juxaposition going on here. Jamie XX of the much lauded, The XX, remixes tracks from Gil Scott Heron&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;m New Here&#8221;. If you like the sound of this then even better news, he&#8217;s remixing the entire album. &#8220;We&#8217;re New Here&#8221; is due out on the 21st of February 2011.
