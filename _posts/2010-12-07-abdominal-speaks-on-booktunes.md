[BookTunes](http://www.booktunerecords.com/) is a curious project. It runs on the theory that music helps you remember things better and a few clever Canadians (who else?) got together and BookTunes was the result. Here Toronto based rapper, Abdominal, speaks on his involvement in the project before giving his rendition of &#8220;The Scarlet Letter&#8221; a spin. I&#8217;ve only picked up &#8220;The Hows of Happiness&#8221; so far, but it&#8217;s a very intriguing concept. Give it a listen.
