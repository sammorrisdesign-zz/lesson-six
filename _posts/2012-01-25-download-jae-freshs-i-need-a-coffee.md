Considering half of the Lesson Six staff is from the UK, we don&#8217;t post as much British Hip-Hop as we should. So, let&#8217;s rectify that with Brighton&#8217;s producer/MC, Jae Fresh, and his recent jazz-inspired release I Need A Coffee. It&#8217;s really interesting to hear British topics on tracks, we don&#8217;t really get enough tracks on the class divide from American artists, unless it involves the hood or the police in some way. Some really great production on this one too, also handled by Jae with &#8220;Wronging&#8221;, &#8220;Today&#8221; & &#8220;Black Coffee&#8221; standing out so far.
