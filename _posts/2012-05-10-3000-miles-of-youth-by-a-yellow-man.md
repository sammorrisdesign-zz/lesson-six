Being British I&#8217;m always up for a bit of a moan, being British and into hip-hop I tend to have British hip-hop to moan about. Bar a handful of artists, too much of our scene has been dominated by the aggressive sounding remnants of garage and grime music. These past few months though, the UK count on Lesson Six gone up and thanks to A Yellow Man, I think my moaning days are over &#8211; well at least about British hip-hop they are. The soulful trio from London not only sound smooth as fuck but also come with intelligent and smart lyrics about everyday life, something that isn&#8217;t easy to capture. Let&#8217;s hope this isn&#8217;t the last we hear from them, British hip-hop needs more of this.
