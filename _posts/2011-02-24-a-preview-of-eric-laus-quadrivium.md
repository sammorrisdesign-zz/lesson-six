With the full release pegged for tomorrow, Eric Lau has released short 30 second previews of every track on his upcoming album, Quadrivium. Have to say, this is sounding pretty good so far, suddenly looking forward to this. In the meantime why not read [our review](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/10/review-eric-lau-makin-sound/) of Eric Lau&#8217;s last album, I hear it&#8217;s pretty good. Ok, cheap plug over, time to listen to the previews.
