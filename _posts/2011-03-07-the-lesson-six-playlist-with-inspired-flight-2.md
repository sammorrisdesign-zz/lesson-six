We spent a few days downtime, due to an impressive server fail, last week meaning we&#8217;ve had too much time to listen to Kwes&#8217; [playlist](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/02/the-lesson-six-playlist-with-kwes/). However, we&#8217;ve still back for another Playlist and we&#8217;ve gotten both OpenOptics &#038; Chavez of Inspired Flight to give us their recently listened playlist.

### OpenOptics&#8217; Three Choices

## Days Are Years by Blue Sky Black Death



I hadn&#8217;t bumped this one in a while, but it played on the Bonobo station on Pandora today, and it reminded me how dope these cats are. When &#8220;A Heap of Broken Images&#8221; first came out, the CD didn&#8217;t leave my car stereo for months. Everything about this song, from the soul samples to the melodic guitar lines, inspires me. I especially love the last 2 minutes or so. It always puts a smile on my face. 

## Beauty by Broadway Project



It&#8217;s really a shame that there&#8217;s only 400 some views on this. This is another track that snuck it&#8217;s way back into my life recently. I used to have this CD, but lost it a few years ago, only to get it again a few months ago. There&#8217;s so much emotion and energy in this song, you can&#8217;t help yourself from bobbing your head. Even though I&#8217;ve listened to this song hundreds of times, I still trip out at the end where the reverse piano crossfades into the normal piano. Genius! 

## Forsaken Cowboy by Royksopp



Royksopp&#8217;s &#8220;Senior&#8221; album was one of my favorite releases of last year (along with Eligh&#8217;s &#8220;Grey Crow&#8221; and Bonobo&#8217;s &#8220;Black Sands&#8221;). If I had to pick one song from the album, it would be this one. It feels like the moment the sun hits your face after days of cloudy skies. 

### Chavez&#8217;s Three Choices

## Lotus Flower by Radiohead



I am a huge Radiohead fan, and I draw much inspiration from their songwriting and production. I love the new album, &#8220;The King Of Limbs&#8221;, that just came out, and though I like every song I really can&#8217;t seem to get this one out of my head. The melody is amazing, and the production is top notch.

## The Pills Won&#8217;t Help You Now by The Chemical Brothers



Perhaps my favorite electronic/dance group is The Chemical Brothers. They not only create amazing dance beats, but they also have a great knack for beautiful songwriting and melody. I recently began listening again to their 2007 album, &#8220;We Are The Night&#8221;, and I especially love this song, which incorporates many of the elements I love about The Chemical Brothers into this one track. 

## Think by Afro Classics



Inspired Flight has been working with the MC, Scarub, who is featured on the first track from our album. Though he is mainly known for being part of Living Legends, he has another project called Afro Classics that is awesome. Their last album, &#8220;Classic Rock&#8221;, is an all-around great, creative hip-hop album, and my favorite song from it is called Think. I always love listening to this track! 3:

_And that&#8217;s your lot this week. Special thanks for Inspired Flight for sharing some good music with us. Next week we&#8217;ll be back with the first half of our 14-track playlist by the 14-piece My Son The Hurricane_
