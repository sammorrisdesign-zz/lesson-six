When we started this thing in August we wanted to share great music and restore people&#8217;s faith in good Hip-Hop. Arguably we&#8217;ve done both of those quite well so far and have learnt alot while doing it, however, we&#8217;re taking Chali 2na&#8217;s advice and stepping our game up.

That might sound weird considering the blog has started to slow down over the past few weeks but for good reason &#8211; we&#8217;re going to the presses and producing the first issue of Lesson Six. We&#8217;ve got a lot lined up for the magazine including interviews with great people and more reviews than you could shake a stick at. All stuff we&#8217;ll be letting you know on the run up to the day we send it to the printers &#8211; the 19th of April where issues will be available shortly after. We&#8217;ve still got a lot to do so bare with us over the next few weeks as the work increases but come the end of the month you&#8217;ll be able to see the fruits of our labour in physical form.

Oh, and we&#8217;re not trying to stay ahead of the game by doing this a day early&#8230;

_If you would like to get involved with Issue One of Lesson Six, whether that be in the form of writing, illustrating or just an artist wanting to get the name out, contact us at staff@lessonsix.com_
