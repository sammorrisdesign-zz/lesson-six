A new one for you here guys. Spotify&#8217;s support for progressive hip-hop is slowly improving, so our support for Spotify has to match it. At the end of each month, we&#8217;re going to dig back through the past thirty-ish days of releases and posts, and create a easily digestible Spotify playlist. Full playlist after the jump&#8230;

So here is July 2012, featuring album choices by Open Mike Eagle, Wordburglar, Aesop Rock & Oddisee along with our favourite tracks of the month. Follow us on [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/lessonsix) to get updates from future playlists.
