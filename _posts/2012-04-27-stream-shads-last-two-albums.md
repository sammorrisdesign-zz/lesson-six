Lesson Six favourite & general relatable Ontario rapper, Shad, has just released his last two albums on [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/shadk/sets). The upbeat bangers on TSOL & the even better complete album of The Old Prince are now available to stream for free. Now all we&#8217;re waiting for is a little bit of Spotify love.
