Since first hearing Cocaine 80&#8242;s last fall right before Common&#8217;s new album dropped, I have been hooked on their music. The combination of the R&B/Soul of James Fauntleroy and the hip-hop production from No I.D with appearances by Common were enough for me. This past week 3 new tracks dropped and Chain Glow is probably the best of the bunch.
