There&#8217;s a reason we haven&#8217;t mentioned Canadian duo Magnolius&#8217; name on Lesson Six. Their last album, Mary Musth came out before we started this thing up. Which makes it weird that a video for a song released in 2009 is only now getting a video, after one quick look at the animation you can kind of understand why. &#8220;King for Hire&#8221; was made by one animator,Â Justin T. Lee, who deserves all the praise for a Magnolius video that was worth the wait.

And while you won&#8217;t find me echoing YouTube commenters that often, Magnolius get back to making great music.
