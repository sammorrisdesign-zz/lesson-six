The first single off of Mr. J Medeiros upcoming EP, the Pale Blue Dot gets a video. The song was released a few weeks back on vinyl which I posted about <a href="http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/pale-blue-dot-by-mr-j-medeiros/" target="_blank">here</a>, and I highly recommend that you order it. This video fits the mood of the song very well with the juxtaposition of Mr. J Medeiros rapping and the vocals from Giannina Ashe.
