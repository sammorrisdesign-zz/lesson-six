Muneshine just dropped his latest dropped the first track off his upcoming solo release, There is Only Today, and it&#8217;s filled with epic. Muneshine gets fierce and referential over a packed, multi-instrument filled beat that just sounds like win. One release we&#8217;ll be look out for in the upcoming months.
