Turn the page on the day, walk away and so the story of _The Streets_ comes to a close. While we suspect Mike Skinner will stay with music, _The Streets_ as a name has come to the end of its run with _Computers & Blues._ It doesn&#8217;t take too many spins before you&#8217;ll realise this album is the perfect send off for a significant name in modern British music.

It&#8217;s tough for artists to stay consistent, especially one like Skinner who constantly evolves. Every release has its themes and raison d&#8217;etre and this can cause a real mixed-bag in terms of quality. Be it the supreme narrative on _A Grand Don&#8217;t Come For Free,_ the optimistic post-rehab Mike on _Everything Is Borrowed_ or the slightly arrogant and fame-gloating Skinner on _Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living_. However, while _Computers & Blues_ occasionally dabbles with technology and the choices we&#8217;ll have to make surrounding it, the album largely borrows from all of Skinner&#8217;s previous work to create a great finale to _The Streets_ name.

> I came to it noon through the tune of a spoon / In a mug in a room, but I knew very soon / That the mug in the room, was the mug yours truly / Because I never stood up for what I wanted to do

You have your _Original Pirate Material_ in the penultimate track &#8220;Trust Me&#8221; &#8211; arguably the triumphant culmination of the sound. The often hated commentary on fame of _A Hardest Way …_ is repeated on &#8220;Without Thinking&#8221; although with a lot more humility. The storytelling of _Don&#8217;t Come For Free_ makes its presence in the cringe-worthy &#8220;OMG&#8221; and the much better &#8220;Roof of your Car&#8221;. Finally, the welcome optimism of _Everything is Borrowed_ feels very similar to &#8220;Lock the Locks&#8221;, the final words we&#8217;ll ever hear from _The Streets_ name in an apt almost confession of why it&#8217;s all ending.

The reasons for which are actually quite clear; the pressure after having too much success at the start. Anyone who has been following his career can sympathise with him, everything new he makes is instantly compared with his latter work. That&#8217;s why Computers & Blues is the perfect send off, it has a little bit of everything from The Streets discography and more. Now that we&#8217;ve reminisced over it all, Mike Skinner has free range to move onto pastures new and wanting to try something new is very commendable in this money-driven industry.
