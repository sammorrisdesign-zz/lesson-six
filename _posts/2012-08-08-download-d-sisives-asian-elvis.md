D-Sisive in an interview recently claimed that he was more interested in the idea of Elvis rather than Elvis&#8217; music. Got to say, as someone who wasn&#8217;t around during Elvis&#8217; run, it&#8217;s very strange that theres still a big market for ElvisÂ impersonators. And so D-Sisive&#8217;s experimental Hip-Hop brings him to a concept album about the concept of Elvis impersonators. You&#8217;re probably going to want to listen to this one.
