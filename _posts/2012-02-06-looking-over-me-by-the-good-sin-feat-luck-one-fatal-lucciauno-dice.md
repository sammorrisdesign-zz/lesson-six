The first track off The Good Sin&#8217;s new album &#8220;The Story of Love X Hate&#8221;, picks up exactly where the Late EP left off. Switch does a great job on the production here, again along similar lines Late, which is perfectly fine, it was one of our favourite releases of last year and we&#8217;ve been craving more ever since. The album is due out on the 14th of February.
