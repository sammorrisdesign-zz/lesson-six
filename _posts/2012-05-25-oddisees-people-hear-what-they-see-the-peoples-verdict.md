The results of taking a camera and a pair of headphones around London&#8217;s southbank, and letting them listen to Oddisee&#8217;s new track. Turns out it sounds like a cacophony of blogs. Great idea though. Off his new album, with the same name as this track, which is due out in a few weeks time.
