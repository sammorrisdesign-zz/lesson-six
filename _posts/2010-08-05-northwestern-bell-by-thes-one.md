It&#8217;s Thursday, so put that microphone down because it&#8217;s time to let the producers shine . The first video is from Thes One, one half of People Under The Stairs.

His album, Lifestyle Marketing, is a 2-disc concept-album that features remixes of _Herb Pilhofer&#8217;s_ advert and radio jingles &#8211; the second disc has the originals for your listening pleasure.

I love this song, from the catchy chorus to the stripped down beats, it&#8217;s almost perfect &#8211; and that little drum-fill tempo change at 1:50 is divine.
