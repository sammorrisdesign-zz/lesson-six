It was incredibly disappointing to not have spent more time with Raashan Ahmad&#8217;s For What You&#8217;ve Lost last year. It undoubtedly would have clocked high in our Best of 2010 Albums. Fortunately Raashan has been busy with videos, with this video for &#8220;Pain on Black&#8221; being the third (unless we missed one), from that great album released at the end of last year. If you don&#8217;t know, now you know. Get on it.
