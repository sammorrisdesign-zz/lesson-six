I don&#8217;t know how many stars are featuring in this but it just shows how big The Beastie Boys influence was. I also don&#8217;t really know what is going on throughout most of it but I&#8217;m pretty sure I like it. Apart from the above trailer for the full thirty minute video, The Beasties also decided to officially show off &#8220;Make Some Noise&#8221; after it had leaked earlier in the week.
