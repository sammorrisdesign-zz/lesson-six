It&#8217;s my final day before I leave you in the good hands of Steven for three weeks, so I decided to mix up the top six a bit. Every week we share six tracks we&#8217;ve been listening to recently, but I honestly wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell you new six tracks by different artists with the busy week I&#8217;ve had. So, here&#8217;s our top six **free** tracks from Bandcamp.

## Stalley &#8211; Babblin&#8217;

I know we only posted this a few weeks back but you can&#8217;t turn down that production. Madlib fans will recognise it, but here it&#8217;s much better.



## YC The Cynic &#8211; Kick Back

With his album on the horizon, it&#8217;s only fair to re-post another excellently produced track.



## Bully Blinders &#8211; The Charlie Sheen Theme

We&#8217;ve got a late review of this January 2010 release, but since I started listening to it, it&#8217;s gone free on BandCamp. Might as well pick up this TV inspired three minutes for free. This is the only one where the individual track isn&#8217;t free, but the whole album is. You might as well get the whole album &#8211; it&#8217;s all good.



## Aero-K &#8211; T.o.Y. Soldiers

Definitely something new to this blog. Free The Robots deliver a great beat for Aero-K&#8217;s Jazsapiens mixtape.



## Iller Than Theirs &#8211; Down The Road

Modern Shark&#8217;s BandCamp is one to subscribe to, if you&#8217;re a cheapskate. Here&#8217;s one of the earlier posts.



## Junk Science &#8211; Millins

We&#8217;ve already reviewed Junk Science&#8217;s most recent album but don&#8217;t take my word for it. Actually I wrote the review, so take my word for it, they&#8217;re good. Here&#8217;s a choice from the Modern Science Sampler.
