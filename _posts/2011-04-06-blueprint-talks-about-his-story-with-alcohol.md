Yesterday saw the release of Blueprint&#8217;s new album Adventures in Counter Culture, an album we&#8217;ll be reviewing in our [first issue of Lesson Six](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/03/off-to-the-presses/). For now though, let&#8217;s listen to Blueprint explain the interesting track &#8220;Keep Bouncing&#8221; and his tales with Alcohol.
