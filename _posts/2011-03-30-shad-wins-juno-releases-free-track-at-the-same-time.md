Over the weekend Shad beat out Drake, D-Sisive and other Canadian artists for rap album of the year at this year&#8217;s Juno Awards. This can only go down as a win for good music as Shad&#8217;s TSOL beat the mainstream favourite Drake. I&#8217;m sure this will take pride and place next to his [Sixie](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/12/album-of-the-year-2010-the-top-ten/) (We don&#8217;t call them that) for Album of the Year 2010.

Anyway, to say thanks to his fans Shad released the Kanye-esque &#8220;Give You All I Can&#8221; for [free](http://www.mediafire.com/?bhaab1hytewaft2).
