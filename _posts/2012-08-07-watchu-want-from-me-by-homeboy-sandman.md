I love how diverse Homeboy Sandman can get. Last week we posted the Jonti produced [&#8220;Brown&#8221;](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/07/brown-by-homeboy-sandman/) where Homeboy Sandman gets all poetic over an experimental beat. This week, he&#8217;s dropped one of the best tracks of the summer in &#8220;Whatchu Want From Me&#8221; where he goes back to his 1000 word a minute rate. This track is from his recently announced album _First of a Living Breed_, that&#8217;s out on Stones Throw on 18th of September.
