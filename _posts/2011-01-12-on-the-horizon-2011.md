Here are Lesson Six we&#8217;ve always got albums on the radar but we&#8217;ve been looking forward to the start of 2011 specifially. Here are a few reasons&#8230;

<!--more-->

The Streets &#8211; Computers & Blues &#8211; 7th Feburary
  
Stalley &#8211; Lincoln Way Nights &#8211; 8th Feburary
  
Blu &#8211; Amnesia &#8211; 15th Feburary
  
Blu &#8211; Her Favorite Colo(u)r &#8211; 15th Feburary
  
Gil Scott Heron & Jamie XX &#8211; We&#8217;re New Here &#8211; 21st Feburary
  
Pharoahe Monch &#8211; W.A.R. (We Are Renegades) &#8211; 22nd Feburary
  
J-Live &#8211; S.P.T.A. (Said Person of That Ability) &#8211; 22nd Feburary (Possibly delayed until Spring)
  
Looptroop Rockers &#8211; Professional Dreamers &#8211; Feburary
  
Blueprint &#8211; Adventure in Counter-Culture &#8211; 1st March

The Streets &#8211; Cyberspace & Reds &#8211; TBA
  
Abdominal & The Obliques &#8211; TBA
  
My Son The Hurricane &#8211; TBA
  
The Funk League &#8211; TBA
  
Elaquent &#8211; The Midnight After &#8211; TBA
  
Ugly Duckling &#8211; TBA

Now this isn&#8217;t everything that&#8217;s due out in the next few months but just what we&#8217;re looking at. I&#8217;d expect a lot of the TBA to be delayed into later March at the minimum but we&#8217;ll see. Whatever happens with the unknowns, we&#8217;ve definitely got more than enough confirmed coming out in the next month. 2011 starting off with a bang.
