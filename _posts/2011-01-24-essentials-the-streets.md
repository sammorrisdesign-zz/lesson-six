With four very different albums in the bag and a hot anticipated fifth and final album on the way, Mike Skinner aka The Streets definitely knows how to make a name in music. With the supposedly final Streets album Computers and Blues out in a fortnight&#8217;s time we take a look back at his discography for those who haven&#8217;t been along for the ride.

## It Was Supposed To Be So Easy

_From the album A Grand Don&#8217;t Come For Free_



The track that kicks off the best Streets album sets up the story that evolves over A Grand Don&#8217;t Come For Free.

## Everything Is Borrowed

_From the album Everything Is Borrowed_



Another first track but this time from his most recent offering, Everything Is Borrowed. It was a feel-good and improved collection of tracks that probably got slated more than they deserved.

## Let&#8217;s Push Things Forward

_From the album Original Pirate Material_



Where it all started. The first Streets album is still a classic despite how it&#8217;s clearly a product of its time.

## Never Went To Church

_From the album The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living_



Another album that was heavily slated in the media for it&#8217;s unrelatable themes but it did give us great tracks like this.

## Trust Me

_From the new album, Computers and Blues_



After leaking a few of the tracks onto Twitter this track almost sounds like old friend. The feeling of the original album definitely helps, but only gets me more excited for Computers and Blues.
