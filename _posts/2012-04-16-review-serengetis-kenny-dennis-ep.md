Rap has always had perverted obsession with sports. Both are undeniably American, rap started and is still dominated by American artists and what&#8217;s more American than competition or getting drunk at a competition. As an outsider (from the UK) looking in, it has always been little strange and almost alienating. However, over the course of this six-track EP, Serengeti, channels American sports in a kind of satirical way that makes it accessible despite the niché character he portrays.

This isn&#8217;t the same Serengeti you&#8217;ve heard on the recent collaboration with Sufjan & Son Jux, nor is it the same Sergenti we enjoyed on last year&#8217;s Family & Friends. This is his alter ego, Chicago working man, Kenny Dennis at his very best.

By now you&#8217;ve probably heard the Shaq-diss banger, &#8220;Shazam&#8221;. Here he calls out Shaq over a genuine comment Shaq-Fu made about Kenny&#8217;s moustache when they were labelmates at a Jive showcase back in 1993. It&#8217;s as ridiculous as it sounds, and coupled with hard hitting production by Jel & Odd Nosdam.

Elsewhere, he left me watching a hour long documentary on Steve Bartman when he admits that he blocked the catch on that infamous night on &#8220;Don&#8217;t Blame Steve&#8221;. He challenges us to beat his fierce battle raps on &#8220;Top That&#8221;. There are also tracks where Kenny introduces himself and tells of past exploits in &#8220;Rib Tips&#8221; & &#8220;Kenny Dennis&#8221;. But the other hero off the EP is waiting at the end.

&#8220;Flat Pop&#8221; is effectively this album&#8217;s &#8220;Dennehy&#8221; released in a post-Das Racist world but in double time. It&#8217;s absurdly brilliant even if the faster pace means you can&#8217;t entirely keep up, when the slight drop after the line &#8220;bulls, bulls, bulls, bulls, bulls, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports&#8221; you&#8217;re already completely on board. What I&#8217;m trying to get at here is that every track on this EP has a reason to be here. Previous Kenny Dennis releases tended to flounder because of their faux-joking nature, here every track has a purpose.

American&#8217;s tend not to get self-parody right, which is what makes this EP great. It&#8217;s concise, it doesn&#8217;t waste your time and, in places, it&#8217;s pretty spot on. All it took was combining a bunch of sports references with a strange character an alternative rapper created.
