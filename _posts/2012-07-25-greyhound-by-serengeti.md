With Classic America Rap (also known as C.A.R) due out in a week, Serengeti &#038; anticon just released this trailer / track preview of &#8220;Greyhound&#8221;. I&#8217;m curious to see where Serengeti&#8217;s unique brand of strange heads to next. [The Kenny Dennis EP](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/04/review-serengetis-kenny-dennis-ep/), that focused on his comedic alter ego of the same name, was a brilliant for it&#8217;s short length and production by Odd Nosdam &#038; Gel. Both of which are doing all the production on C.A.R. but for what so far sounds like a 100% Serengeti Dave release. C.A.R. is due out on the 31st of July.
