Today we&#8217;ve been deliberating our Album of the Year list (don&#8217;t fret, it&#8217;s coming out tomorrow) and appropriately I&#8217;ve been listening to the plethora of great albums that came out in 2010. One of which, Incise&#8217;s Daily Methods, featured tons of previously unknown underground artists. Artists that I failed to follow up on, despite being impressed by. Nieve was one that excelled and it&#8217;s only today, a good five months after initially listening to his bars on &#8220;Got To Go&#8221;, that I&#8217;ve followed him up. He&#8217;s just released an album called PlayBack and while it came out a little too late for our Album of the Year list, you have to listen to the instant classic that is &#8220;Troubles of the Past&#8221;.

Just listen to that loop, you&#8217;ve got to love it.
