The distinctively recognisable member of former LA based rap group Jurassic 5, Chali 2na has just released a teaser for his previously unannounced project &#8220;Against The Current&#8221;. The video doesn&#8217;t give away much in information or dates except that &#8220;5 Genre-Bending EPs&#8221; are coming soon. From what little music is featured, it sounds promising &#8211; more on this when we hear more.
