I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve heard of _J. Howells Werthman_ but apparently I have heard him, he did a lot of production for Iller Than Theirs&#8217; album.

Anyway here&#8217;s an exciting piece of news, he&#8217;s teaming up with _Baje One of Junk Science_ to release an eight track album called _What&#8217;s It Going To Be_. You can order one of the 100 limited edition vinyls from [Modern Shark](http://modernshark.com/baje-one-of-junk-science-j-howells-werthman-whats-it-gonna-be-vinyl) now. Or you could listen to &#8220;Tiny Drill&#8221; below. Or you could do both, actually, do both.
