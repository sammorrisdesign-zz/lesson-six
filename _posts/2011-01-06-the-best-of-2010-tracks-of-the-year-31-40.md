When it came to our EP or Album lists we easily decided on our top five or ten, respectively, but then we had to debilerate a list of tracks. It&#8217;s only when you look back on the entire year that you realise how much good music was released. While we couldn&#8217;t boil down our tracks of the year into a top ten, we settled on an even top forty. We&#8217;ll be rolling these out over the next four days, starting today with tracks numbered 31-40.
