I missed this track, but its never too late to share good music. This is a really great track with some Nujabes influenced jazzy production. Witness sounds great on this type of production and I am looking forward to hearing more work. You can download the full track on <a href="http://witness.bandcamp.com/track/twenty-years-from-tomorrow" target="_blank">bandcamp</a>
