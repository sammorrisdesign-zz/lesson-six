Never has an artist&#8217;s name been more apt than Ghostpoet&#8217;s as eery interference noises, reverberating vocals and haunting bass litter his first album, Peanut Butter Blues & Melancholy Jam. However, while that only takes care of the &#8220;Ghost&#8221;, the poetry isn&#8217;t far behind half although start thinking less traditional poetry and more commentary on British day-to-day city life. This probably means we&#8217;re actually hearing mobile phone interference, vocals from an underpass and bass from upstairs.

<!--more-->

The latter being the most important as rather than making the noise himself Ghostpoet comes across as more of a pragmatic grime artist more interested in talking about what he knows. This can range from pork pies and Pro Evo to an emcee&#8217;s toll with personal confidence in their writing. All delivered in an apathetic and slurring nature as if half asleep.

That&#8217;s not to say that Ghostpoet is lazy, in fact this style of delivery allows anyone to get into the lyrics a little more (something we&#8217;re advocates of at Lesson Six). The meaning might be more complex than first appeared but most tracks are made clearer and in a way this less impressive style of emceeing is more effective for the message.

> I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing here, but I gotta keep on doing it / Don&#8217;t ask me what my plan is because I&#8217;m not quite sure I&#8217;ve planned it / I&#8217;m just sitting here drinking / Playing Pro Evo and thinking / But I think I&#8217;ve got it worked out now but I don&#8217;t if I&#8217;ve got an inkling

Peanut Butter Blues & Melancholy Jam has a lot going against it. The drowsy vocals slowly delivering everyday English city life musings over dubstep-esque and muffled production is hardly the most accessible. However, though this experiment we can hear a sound as striking as The Streets in 2001. Unlike Mike Skinner&#8217;s rebellious attempt to create something different from Garage, and unfortunately for Ghostpoet himself, this sound isn&#8217;t as marketable.

Then again, considering how the mainstream perception of Skinner&#8217;s work has stupidly declined over the past decade, maybe Ghostpoet should count his blessings &#8211; he&#8217;s unique and should have a lot more creative freedom in the future because of this. Ultimately this means that while Peanut Butter Blues & Melancholy Jam is well realised and an incredibly unique listen, we should be able to expect more to come from a very promising artist with an intriguing career ahead of him. Very deserving of your attention.
