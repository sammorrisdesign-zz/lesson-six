Posthumous albums are almost always really hard to support and get into because it usually doesn&#8217;t have the same feel as the artists original work. In this case though, J Dilla&#8217;s legacy has been closely maintained by his mother and this project was brought to life with his mother&#8217;s blessings and hard work in putting the album together. While this album is no where close to what Dilla&#8217;s work was/is, it is still very good. Â You can stream the full album below
