Last year we saw Serengeti take a very serious approach to his music. Dropping the Kenny Dennis alter-ego and making a much more personal sound. While we were massive fans, it&#8217;s still good to see KDZ back on the beat. This Shaq-diss, produced by Anticon mainstays Jel & Odd Nosdam, is off Serengeti&#8217;s upcoming release &#8220;Kenny Dennis EP&#8221;. It&#8217;s good to see him address the difference between David Cohn Serengeti and Kenny Dennis Serengeti, even if it is in album name only.
