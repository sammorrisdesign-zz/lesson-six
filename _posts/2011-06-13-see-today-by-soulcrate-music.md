South Dakota&#8217;s trio, Soulcrate Music, were one of my favourite emerging artists of 2010 and its good to see them back with their new EP _The Kick Rocks Collection_. At times _The Heartland Pani_c, their 2010 album, embodied exactly what Lesson Six was set up for, so I&#8217;m anxious to give their new stuff ago. In the meantime here&#8217;s the video for the opening track of the new EP, &#8220;See Today&#8221;
