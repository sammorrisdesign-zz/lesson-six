It&#8217;s a little tough to classify exactly what genre this belongs to but who cares, there are rarely moments of clarity and beauty in music like this. We missed Long Arm&#8217;s release, _The Branches_, last year but this track just had to make an apparence on the site as soon as I heard it. [Get on it](http://projectmooncircle.bandcamp.com/album/the-branches).
