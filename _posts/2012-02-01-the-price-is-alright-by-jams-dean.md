I&#8217;m probably missing the point here, but it wasn&#8217;t the lyrical content here that posed a question. It was actually the production that made me wonder, why we don&#8217;t get more beats made from game show themes. I mean, they&#8217;re mostly instrumental, and ripe for clever word play and parody. A great example of that is the title track off, Chicago based rapper, Jams Dean&#8217;s 2010 [mixtape](http://soundcloud.com/jamsdean) &#8211; as he literally does the opposite of mainstream rap and talks about how he isn&#8217;t famous and doesn&#8217;t have money.
