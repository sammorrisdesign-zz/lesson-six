As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re already aware, today Adam Yauch aka MCA of The Beastie Boys has passed away at the age of 47. The reason for already being aware is from the outcry and incredible show of support across the hip-hop community on blogs and Twitter. None more apt than the following quote from [Sasha Frere-Jones](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2012/05/adam-yauch-mca-beastie-boys.html#ixzz1u0BSZeY5) in the New Yorker, &#8220;Adam Yauch was a part of my childhood, an ambassador to America from our New York, which is now gone, as is he.&#8221; There has been an official obituary of sorts put out on the [Beastie&#8217;s website](http://beastieboys.com/), that pays great tribute to one of the pioneers of this genre.

R.I.P Adam Yauch
