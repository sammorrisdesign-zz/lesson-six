Another hectic weekend over and it&#8217;s time for the Top Six. Been doing a little digging this week, finding new stuff to share as well as old gems that I continue to enjoy. That&#8217;s what I love about Hip-hop, it&#8217;s so eclectic, there&#8217;s something out there that will sway even the biggest hater and match every mood possible. Even if it is a bad one.

## Steg G and Loki &#8211; I Can&#8217;t Go On This Way

I was digging about for some good Scottish hip-hop, and I&#8217;ll admit that the accent, my accent, does get in the way sometimes. It just doesn&#8217;t work for some people. But this guy, _Loki_ from Glasgow, is the one that has stood out so far. Listened to this track far too much recently.



## Das Racist &#8211; You Oughta Know

Their new album came out last week and I&#8217;ve been listening to their first in preparation for reviewing it. &#8220;You Oughta Know&#8221; is just too much fun, a great tune.
  


## The Herbaliser Ft. Roots Manuva

Roots played Eden festival which is very close to me. I was a bit gutted I couldn&#8217;t go and even more gutted that my cousin bailed before he came on. This is a great collaboration with _The Herbaliser_.
  


## Darkleaf &#8211; Alkami

I&#8217;ve been looking for more stuff by _Hymnal_ after over-listening to his work with _Cut Chemist_. This is one of the first groups he was in and I want more. Might have to go dig in the crates some more.
  


## Ty &#8211; The Idea (feat. De La Soul)

Yeah, I&#8217;ve been loving _Ty_ recently. And _De La Soul_ makes everything better.
  


## Handsome Boy Modelling School &#8211; Metaphysical (It&#8217;s a good day)

Continuing the Prince Paul connection and ending things very chilled. Just hoping I&#8217;ll be saying this tomorrow.
