Sometimes it&#8217;s just way too hard to keep up with the amount of music that comes out these days, this album from The Black Opera, released on quite possibly one of the best hip-hop labels in Mello Music Group, is a perfect example of that. I saw a few things about The Black Opera, but I had no idea about this album, or their previous two installments in this series either. Even after the discovery, I can&#8217;t say much about the other two albums, but this last one is great. It is a sprawling concept album effort, that has some poignant rhymes and great production. This is one album I would highly recommend purchasing.
