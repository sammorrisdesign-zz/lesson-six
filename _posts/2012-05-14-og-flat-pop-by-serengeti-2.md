Anticon just posted this original version, or outtake, of &#8220;Flat Pop&#8221; on Geti King&#8217;s Kenny Dennis EP. From the sounds of it they probably picked the right version for the final cut, but even Gel &#038; Odd Nosdam&#8217;s throwaways sound great. Download it on the Anticon [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/anticon/serengeti-og-flat-pop).
