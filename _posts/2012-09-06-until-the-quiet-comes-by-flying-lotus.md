A stunning short film from Flying Lotus directed by Kahlil Joseph to promote his upcoming album of the same name. Really powerful visuals backed by some great music from FlyLo. This isn&#8217;t something to just glance over once, pay attention to the music, the dance, and the visuals to really see the message.
