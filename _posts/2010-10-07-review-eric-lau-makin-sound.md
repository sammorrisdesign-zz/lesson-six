You may remember we previewed this album a few weeks back on a previous Instrumental Thrusday and we liked what we heard. Well the album came out on the 27th and I&#8217;ve been listening to it quite a bit over the past week.

I won&#8217;t deny that my interest was  a little biased as I always get a bit excited about new releases from British MC&#8217;s and producers. It&#8217;s good to see your home team doing well, you know? One thing I really like about instrumental albums is when an artist splits up the space into a lot of small 2-minute tracks. If gives the producer a lot to play around with, allowing him to switch styles and beats with ease.

<!--more-->Some may use this to the extreme, throwing in some completely different sounds as the album progresses, while others try and keep a general &#8216;vibe&#8217; throughout. 

_Makin&#8217; Sound_ is definitely in the latter category. The album switches but keeps it jazzy and smooth throughout. It will have your head swaying and your feet tapping. It&#8217;s kind of sexy.

&#8220;Lil Chop&#8221; exemplifies this; short, with a great little beat and a sexy sample. But then it kicks in with some emcce sampling on the next track and a fatter beat. If you just listen through that you can still hear that soft, higher note that seems to ebb through every track of the album. It&#8217;s almost like water, gently bubbling and rippling throughout. And it&#8217;s a good thing.

The album strips down for the majority of the middle, keeping that smooth sounds going. &#8220;Give Light, Give Love&#8221; is one of the best of the tracks, definitely a stand out. The end of the album matches the highs of the start with &#8220;Noma&#8217;s&#8221; flutes complementing the beats and creating something quite special.

The album slides into your ears and passes through your mind and body leaving you thoroughly relaxed. It&#8217;s the kind of album that needs the perfect setting, even the perfect company. It may even be too relaxed for some people. And in a way that&#8217;s one of it&#8217;s only faults; it lacks the memorable, catchy tracks that some people may be looking for; but to me, it gives the album more of an identity

It&#8217;s a difficult line to walk, and regardless of this, _Makin&#8217; Sounds_ does it well by crafting a distinct sound that shapes every beat it touches.
