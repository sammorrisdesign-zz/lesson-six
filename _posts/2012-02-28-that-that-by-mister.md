Some great jazz hip-hop here by one half of Passalacqua, Mister. Here Mister elevates what would otherwise be another track about relationships, to something a little special, down in part to his well exhibited self-awareness & reflection. This track is off his recently released solo EP, _Just So You Know_, which you can grab on [Bandcamp](http://dr-b.bandcamp.com/album/just-so-you-know).
