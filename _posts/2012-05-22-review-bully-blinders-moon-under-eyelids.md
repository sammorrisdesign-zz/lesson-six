_Moon Under Eyelids_ feels very much like a sophomore album. Compared to 2010&#8242;s boom-bap joyride that was City of Dirt, this feels way more mature and a bit of a change in direction for the duo. Occasions like this often devolve in people declaring their love for the &#8220;earlier work&#8221; but Bully Blinders have fairly successfully added maturity to their sound without compromising inherent listenablity.

This maturity has turned them from covering comedy and heavily political issues to more of a journal filled with love letters to ex-girlfriends and lost-childhood memories. It&#8217;s safe to say that the Bully Blinders are covering topics that even the most conscious rapper won&#8217;t touch, and it feels like it&#8217;s a much more honest and open record. Regret tinged lyrics hit with a confident take-action air to them, a recluse&#8217;s fight music.

> &#8220;All this physical stuff doesn&#8217;t really mean much, unless it&#8217;s a branch taken from the family tree, passed down with a story to accompany the item, that&#8217;s what I call a treasure you should never place a price on&#8221;

A change in production matches the new feel perfectly, and Bully Blinders have made it 100% themselves, an honorable task. However, the guitars and occasional piano or accordion heavy tracks tend to blend into each other after awhile. But it&#8217;s nice to see both halves, step out of their comfort zones. Even if it&#8217;s swapping raw boom-bap for more of a pop sound.

Two years, ago we questioned why these guys weren&#8217;t bigger and this latest move probably won&#8217;t broaden their appeal as much as it should. In a fair world, we can&#8217;t imagine it will take much longer before these guys get theirs. Until then Moon Under Eyelids ticks off a couple more skills on the CV, with diverse and versatility being near the top.
