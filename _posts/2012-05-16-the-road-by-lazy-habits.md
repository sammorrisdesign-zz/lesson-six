There&#8217;s something about an MC with a live band that keeps the lyrics humble. Fellow Brits, Lazy Habits don&#8217;t break that trend with their soon to be released self-titled debut album. In the meantime though, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll want to stay tuned for the full release after this, here are visuals for the lead single &#8220;The Road&#8221;. Just in time for the summer.
