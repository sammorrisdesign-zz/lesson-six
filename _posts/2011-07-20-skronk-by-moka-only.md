I&#8217;ve always been of two minds about Moka Only. On one hand he&#8217;s a competent rapper with a tendency for picking out great sounding beats. On the other hand, he&#8217;s kind of like the one in the family you don&#8217;t talk about. Normally I&#8217;d point out how strange a track called Skronk is, but let&#8217;s save some time. All you need to know is that this track is strangely addictive.
