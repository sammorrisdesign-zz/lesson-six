This is more for the production than the lyrical content as anyone who listens to [Phantogram](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqqsTtmMUYg) will instantly recognise the beat. If you like the sound of it, download the album from [P.SO&#8217;s Bandcamp](http://psotheearthtoneking.bandcamp.com/). I can&#8217;t vouch for the clich√©-freeness of it but I can confirm the production is great throughout.
