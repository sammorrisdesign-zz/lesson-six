What a great collection of instrumentals this one is. The 19 year-old Hashbrown has a whopping thirty-seven of 60s and 70s funk inspired beats for you to feast on. Let&#8217;s hope we&#8217;ll be seeing a lot more of this eclectic producer throughout the year. The collection is available on one of those name your price deals.
