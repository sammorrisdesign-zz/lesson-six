A little more from Trebles and Blues&#8217; upcoming debut album, The Blue Note. Really loving the camera work on this short video and I know you shouldn&#8217;t judge a book by its cover (or an artist by his cover art or video production) but it really goes along away. Looking forward to this one. The Blue Note is due out on the 1st of March.
