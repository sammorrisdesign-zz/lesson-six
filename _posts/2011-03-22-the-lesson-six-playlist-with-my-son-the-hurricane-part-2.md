The second half of, a now belated, playlist by the fourteen piece duo My Son The Hurricane. They&#8217;ve been a lot busier than we have recently, touring with Lesson Six favourite D-Sisive while counting down the days to the release of their new album, due out on April the 5th. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve listen to as much as I would like but Pushin&#8217; Up Daises is sounding pretty good.

# &#8220;Weather Forecast&#8221; by Henry Bowers



**Danno O&#8217;Shea (Drums)** Hiphop needs more banjo and upright bass.

# &#8220;Quote Unquote&#8221; by Mr. Bungle



 **Abe Bergsma** The circus of the damned! Organized recklessness, and one of Bungle&#8217;s best videos.

# &#8220;Don&#8217;t Be Sad&#8221; by Brad Mehldau



**Alex Duncan (Trombone)** I absolutely love the way this song seamlessly blends different styles together, into something new and amazing. The harmonies and voicings also blow me away.

# &#8220;Hip-Hop Saved My Life&#8221; by Lupe Fiasco



**Andrew Harwood (Alto Sax)** Lupe&#8217;s album, The Cool was one of the first albums that got me really into hip-hop, and I&#8217;m stoked to finally hear &#8216;Lasers&#8217;. Love this song, and love the album.

# &#8220;Viscera Eyes&#8221; by The Mars Volta



**Nelson Beattie (Baritone Sax)** For some reason I never listened to these guys when I was younger. I love this song and the album. The song is a 9min trip. I felt uneasy the first time I listened to it, but I like it now.

# &#8220;Bourbon Street Parade&#8221; by Leroy Jones&#8221;



**Troy Dowding (Trumpet)** Been listening to these too cats for a good long while now. A far as horn players go I&#8217;m pretty convinced they got it all going on! Not to mention Hary Connicks killin&#8217; band!!

# &#8220;Mutter&#8221; by Rammstein



**Andrew Samitz (Keys)** In the hopes that I&#8217;ll be able to use my new concert ticket when they come to Toronto, this track has entered my regular playlist.

_Just in case you&#8217;ve missed it, here&#8217;s the [other half of the band&#8217;s](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/03/the-lesson-six-playlist-with-my-son-the-hurricane-part-1/) playlist from last week. Special thanks to everyone in My Son The Hurricane for giving us the time and the tracks. We&#8217;ll be back next week with 10.4 Rog if everything goes to plan._
