It&#8217;s been a few months since Lesson Six&#8217;s first birthday passed without much fanfare. Yet in the last year (and 5 months) we&#8217;ve learnt a lot about the way users like to listen and learn about music. Which is why today, your eyes are pointed directly at the new look Lesson Six.

While we&#8217;ve revamped the look and functionality of the website &#8211; like the Listen to Lesson Six feature, which lets you easily listen to the last twenty tracks we&#8217;ve posted &#8211; we&#8217;re coupling this fresh lick of paint with an improved direction. Earlier in the year we published our first newspaper and it allowed us to write features and ask the questions in interviews, it was a great experience for us. However, without it becoming a regular thing it means that we&#8217;re going to need to have a site that is better suited for presenting features, interviews and reviews. This is that very site.

We hope you enjoy what you see on Lesson Six over the upcoming weeks as we start to roll out our new ideas and features.

Thanks for reading
