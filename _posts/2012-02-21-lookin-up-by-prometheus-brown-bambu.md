Last summer just weeks after the Blue Scholars released Cinemetropolis, which was one of our top records from the past year, Prometheus Brown teamed up with Bambu to release Prometheus Brown & Bambu Walk Into A Bar. This is one release that was heavily slept on last year, and it deserves to be listened too, so check the full record out over <a href="http://beatrockmusic.bandcamp.com/album/walk-into-a-bar" target="_blank">here</a>.

Now on to the actual video. Lookin Up is a dope song that has some pretty inspirational lines, and the video fits the mood of the song perfectly. There really isn&#8217;t much to the video asides from some concert footage of the song being performed, and Prometheus Brown (Geo) and Bambu sitting on a couch rapping while using their hands as visuals. Check the video out.
