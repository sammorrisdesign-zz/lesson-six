A quick teaser for the long awaited 3rd DJ Format album, Statement of Intent. While it hasn&#8217;t been announced that, personal favourite and frequent collaborator, Abdominal will feature, it does include the UK&#8217;s DJ Format collaborating with Edan, Mr. Life, Sureshot La Rock, Phill Most Chill and more. This is the first we&#8217;ve heard about a follow up to 2005 album, If You Can&#8217;t Join &#8216;em, Beat &#8216;em, since he dropped the [Mr.DJ/Dope Pusher EP](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/02/dope-pusher-by-dj-format/) nearly a whole year ago. The album is due out on February 27th 2012.
