Wow, thats all I have to say after listening to this short four track EP of remixes/edits by Oddisee. The first glimpse we got off this EP was &#8220;Ain&#8217;t That Peculiar&#8221;, which was originally a Marvin Gaye song, and well lets just say I think this version is dope. Going back though, the opening track of this EP is titled &#8220;Paralyze&#8221; and is a remix of Bon Iver&#8217;s &#8220;re:stacks,&#8221; and the production is exactly what I have come to love with Oddisee, similar to his Rock Creek Park EP. I am also really impressed by Oddisee&#8217;s flow, which up until this year we really haven&#8217;t heard much off. This short remix EP just makes me want to hear Oddisee&#8217;s full length debut LP even more. Make sure to pick this one up as its free.
