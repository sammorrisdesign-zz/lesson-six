Most of us know Phonte from his work with The Foreign Exchange and/or Little Brother, but after this album, Phonte might start to gain recognition for his solo career. Charity Starts at Home is an album for the common man, songs such as the opener Dance in the Reign showcase Phonte&#8217;s lyrical ability, but also a reality on why hip hop is his career. Personal favorite from this album is The Good Fight
