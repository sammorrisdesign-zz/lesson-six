Common has long been one of the best rappers in the game, catching his break in the early 90&#8242;s and continuing to release music into the past decade and now an album coming up this November. Many artists live their lives in closed doors and us as fans do not get to see their struggles or their triumphs. In _One Day It&#8217;ll All Make Sense_ Common opens up into his life and takes us through his thought process as an artist, but more importantly as a man. Reading this book, we get a new sense of how hard it is to become &#8220;big&#8221; in the industry and how with the right influences and ideas, anyone can make it in this world. After reading this book, there is a mutual appreciation that I have for Common and the message that he puts in many of this songs like Be or I Used to Love H.E.R that would otherwise be unknown.
