Another week&#8217;s worth of digging through the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">crates</span> iTunes culminates in another weekly top six. Some real favourites in there this week, hope you like them too.

## The Others &#8211; Who We Be

I&#8217;m not sure what reminded me of The Others this week but I&#8217;m glad it happened.



## The Residents &#8211; Nocturnal

If I remember correctly this album was free and not bad.



## Y Society &#8211; Scientist

I&#8217;m late to the party on this one, just discovered them.



## Kanser &#8211; Positive Punchlines

Just heard about Kanser recently and I&#8217;ll have to admit I&#8217;m still in two minds. While they border on clich√©, a lot of it seems regretful retrospectively. This track about staying alcohol free is pretty good, even if the way in which the Alicia Steele delivers her part at the end sounds a little preachy.



## Colossus &#8211; Thrupenny Bits (Remix)

Colossus is an excellent producer who should probably should be bigger than he is at the moment. Here is a remix of Thrupenny Bits featuring vocals by Roots Manuva.



## Tor/Sufjan Stevens &#8211; That Dress Looks Nice On You / Make You Feel That Way

I was about to post the original by Gift of Gab but why, when this exists. Brilliant remix.
