Although we strive to provide you unique sounds in this thing called hip-hop, sometimes some hip-hop ass hip-hop is exactly what you need. Put simply, that&#8217;s why J-Live&#8217;s long awaited album, S.P.T.A, was ranked so highly on our [album countdown](http://www.lessonsix.com/2012/02/the-best-of-2011-albums-of-the-year) of last year. Tracks like &#8220;The Authentic&#8221; prove why it was worth the wait.
