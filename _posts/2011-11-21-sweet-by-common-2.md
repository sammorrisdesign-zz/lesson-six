Really looking forward to the upcoming album by Common. Just a couple days ago we got the video for his second track Sweet from the album. The song is very rough, and the video is as well. Almost a little bit over the top. Also the cover art for the album was released and it [looks](http://www.lessonsix.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/dreamercover.jpg) pretty sick.
