While I unfortunately didn&#8217;t get a chance to listen to too much new material while I was away, I&#8217;m sure I could muster up my first top six in a month. It&#8217;s probably only fair.

## Teebs &#8211; Why Like This?

Been looking forward to the new Teebs album ever since we [featured him](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/09/rains-by-teebs-jackhigh/) last month. Here&#8217;s the next single from Ardour.



## Jurassic 5 &#8211; Ducky Boy

One of the few albums I get to listen to was the bonus disc on the re-issue of Jurassic 5&#8242;s first self-titled EP. It&#8217;s pretty decent. I must have missed this video to commemorate it&#8217;s release last year though.



## J-Live &#8211; Poetry In Motion

The other half of &#8220;The Way That I Rhyme EP&#8221; that came out a few months ago. New album should be out soon as well.



## Shad &#8211; Out of Love

Before I went I did an Essential feature on Shad and stupidly ignored this track. Let&#8217;s make up for that.



## Incise &#8211; Mid-Day

Now that I&#8217;m back we can dial up the Incise again.



## Junk Science &#8211; Do It Easy (Daedelus Remix)

After many trips to Amoeba I managed to find Junk Science&#8217;s underrated sophomore album, complete with beer mat, Grandad&#8217;s Nerve Tonic. Time to share some.
