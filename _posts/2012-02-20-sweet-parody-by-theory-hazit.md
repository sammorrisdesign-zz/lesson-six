First of all, its safe to say that Common and Theory Hazit are both heavily involved in my daily music rotation, but Theory Hazit might have just made one of the funniest and wittiest parody song and video I&#8217;ve ever seen. If you recall the video for Common&#8217;s Sweet which in actuality is a very rough, grimy and angry song, Common plays the role of a tough, hard-nosed MC, if you haven&#8217;t seen it click <a title="Lesson 6 Common &quot;Sweet&quot;" href="http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/11/sweet-by-common-2/" target="_blank">here</a>. Now Theory Hazit absolutely changes the way you listen to Sweet and it is pretty spectacular.
