I&#8217;m so glad that this track has surfaced as it has brought Serengeti back to my attention. We did a little feature with him and Sicker Man for their upcoming collaboration in our [magazine](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/05/lesson-six-issue-one-now-available/), but despite [&#8220;Accommodating&#8221;](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/03/accommodating-by-sicker-man-feat-serengeti/) being a great track, it was last year&#8217;s [&#8220;Flutes&#8221;](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/10/flutes-by-serengeti/) that stuck with me. It was a strange release, seemingly not attached to any project until now. Serengeti&#8217;s new solo albumÂ _Family & Friends_ is due out July the 19th and not only will it feature &#8220;Flutes&#8221; but this great track as well. One to look out for.
