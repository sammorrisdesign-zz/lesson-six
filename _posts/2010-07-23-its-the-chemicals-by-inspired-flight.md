I&#8217;m currently debating whether this album should be reviewed for what is essentially a hip-hop site. Why? Well only five of the twelve tracks could be classified as a form of hip hop. While as a whole it&#8217;s probably not worth it, those five tracks are something else. Here&#8217;s the first song of the album, It&#8217;s The Chemicals featuring Scarub.
