For one, it might be a stretch to have M.I.A on this site, but she was and still is heavily influenced by hip-hop music. Bad Girls is the first single from her upcoming album and the video is nothing short of spectacular. The video was directed by Romain Gervais, who also directed M.I.A&#8217;s Born Free. The video is really daring and the music is eccentric to say the least.
