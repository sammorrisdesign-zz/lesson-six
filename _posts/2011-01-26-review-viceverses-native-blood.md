It would appear that _Viceverses_ aren&#8217;t here to make friends. Political agendas and strong life-views combined with nontraditional beats means the trio should be incredibly inaccessible. Yet they don&#8217;t compromise on their message by feeling overly preachy or pretentious. It&#8217;s enough for the casual listener to enjoy the experimental sounds while those wanting to go deeper will find meaning. Quite impressive for the three from Cleveland who surprisingly haven&#8217;t garnered a sizable online following.

That&#8217;s not to say that _Viceverses_&#8216; second LP _Native Blood_ is universally accessible. They&#8217;re political, opinionated and most importantly, intelligent. The Double V remain humble and know if their messages need to be correctly transmitted, unintelligible anger on the mic isn&#8217;t going to work. Instead they spout their spiritual views with humility and wit.

The majority of the album focuses on injustice against minorities and other such issues with the world. They target greedy consumerism culture in &#8220;Back To The Basics&#8221; while taking pleasure in simplicity with &#8220;Catharsis&#8221;. The latter of which is only equalled by the interrogation given to mainstream rap in &#8220;Walnuts&#8221;. But by staying the right side of uncrossable preachy line they actually make some good music in the process.

> We&#8217;re to prove that hip-hop just ain&#8217;t for dancing / Ever stop to think that fity is a modern day, Charlie Manson?

Naturally a few tracks rise above the rest but this short LP delivers no duds, and that is largely down to the overall great sound. Cut up samples found on the the title track whine throughout as tribal drums thump out over &#8220;Congo Square&#8221;. This is a rarely bass-driven album that does anything but stay in the box. Everything production wise seems to assimilate the themes and lyrics. The perfect accompaniment to very experimental and exploratory listen.

This experimentation is what makes _Native Blood_ what it is. It&#8217;s not for very everyone but it&#8217;s about as accessible as political, as experimental & as intelligent, hip-hop is likely to get anytime soon.
