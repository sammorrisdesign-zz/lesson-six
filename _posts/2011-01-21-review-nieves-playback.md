And so it progressed from a guest spot on a producer&#8217;s soundtrack to the summer to a fully fledged album. Although, if I could be frank his guest spot on _Incise&#8217;s Daily Methods_ hardly blew me away. A little blunt, maybe, but there were a lot of artists trying to break through and unfortunately _Nieve_ wasn&#8217;t one of them. Well, unfortunate for me. It turns out that all the LA based rapper needed was a whole LP to himself. As he exclaims on &#8220;There For Me&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing fine on my own / I feel fine on my own&#8221;.

It&#8217;s definitely not what that track is about but it rings true. All he needed was a full album, backed up by an in-form Incise on the production, to fully grow on his own. The result is a highly enjoyable listen, if there ever was one. Soulful beats by someone who&#8217;s slowly becoming our favourite producer at Lesson Six and smart humble lyrics.

> Put all the troubles on the backburner / Let it blow steam / And forget it all happened like old dreams

That beautiful combination of feel-good writing and jazz infused production finds the sweet spot for a majority of _Playback._ &#8220;Troubles of the Past&#8221; is easily the standout as _Nieve_ speaks on the importance of looking forward over a spirited piano loop. Equally as good is the relaxing sound found on &#8220;Doin That Today&#8221; which is primed for feet up, eyes closed on a sunny day. It&#8217;s just a shame it&#8217;s Winter.

Apart from the time of the release (which is hard to hold against it) _Playback_ does occasionally wander into that cringe-worthy half of the feel-good soulful hip-hop camp. &#8220;Still You Gotta Rise&#8221; is an interesting experiment but is ultimately a failed one. Blame the boy-band-esque production on that one. Also, Nieve shows some naivety on the joke gone too far on &#8220;Straight To Ya Mama&#8221;. Blame a different kind of cringe-worthy on that one.

To be frank, it&#8217;s tough to pick faults with _Playback_. Not because it&#8217;s our first five star review, because (and I&#8217;m sorry) but it&#8217;s not. Mainly because the whole album comes across very smoothly. It&#8217;s nothing revolutionary, just solid Californian underground hip-hop with soulful beats and humble lyricism. When it works it&#8217;s a beautiful thing and _Nieve&#8217;s Playback_ is largely the result of very defined, yet beautiful, sound. A sound that is very listenable and highly recommendable.
