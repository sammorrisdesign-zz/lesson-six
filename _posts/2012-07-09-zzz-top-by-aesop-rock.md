With Skelethon due out on Tuesday, Aesop Rock has been busy. Not content to release a [video explaining](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=behind+skelethon&oq=behind+skelethon&gs_l=youtube-reduced.3...131431.134714.0.137206.16.14.0.2.2.1.139.1222.9j5.14.0...0.0.pBlH4wC02Js) every track on the highly anticipated album, he&#8217;s just dropped a video for the 2nd single &#8220;ZZZ Top&#8221;. Here Aesop Rock fluently describes the emotions of a younger man discovering a new genre of music, with each verse getting deeply referential for a different genre of music. Set to a awesome fight scene.
