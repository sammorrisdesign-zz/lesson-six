The only reason I picked up the last track (now been removed from YouTube) we featured that was produced by The Funk League was because Andy Cooper of Ugly Duckling was on it. I&#8217;m glad I did though, they sound a lot like Young Einstein and that&#8217;s always a good thing. Even better news, they&#8217;ve just finished their first album.
