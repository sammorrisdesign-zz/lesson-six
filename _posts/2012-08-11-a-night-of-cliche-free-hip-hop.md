We&#8217;re pleased to announce that, in conjuction with Screen Social, we&#8217;re holding our first night celebrating everything that is cliché-free hip-hop.

Featuring Bristol’s own Folk-Hop / Spoken Word crossover artist <a href="http://claytonblizzard.com/" target="_blank">Clayton Blizzard</a>, playing an acoustic set with tracks from his newly released album _Analogue Is Better Than Digital_. We’ll also have a screening of the seminal alternative Hip-Hop documentary, _Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats & Rhymes_. An intriguing documentary by a self-confessed ‘Hip-Hop Head’, as filmmaker Byron Hurt takes a look at the lyrics behind the music he loves and examines the issues that plague mainstream hip-hop culture. Finally, we&#8217;ll also be screening our favourite music videos along with [Screen Social&#8217;s](http://www.screensocial.com/) regular host of short videos.

So come join us at **The Book Club** in **Shoreditch, London **on **Thursday 16th of August **for a night of alternative hip-hop and film. Tickets are available for £3 at the door or £2 if you buy them [online here](http://screensocial11.eventbrite.com/).
