When Dumbfoundead gets all introspective, he&#8217;s hard to beat. That&#8217;s why last year we gave him track of the year for [&#8220;Are We There Yet?&#8221;](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/07/are-we-there-yet-by-dumbfoundead/). This new track &#8220;Growing Young&#8221; lives up to that quality. His next album _Take The Stares_ is due out on the 16th of October.
