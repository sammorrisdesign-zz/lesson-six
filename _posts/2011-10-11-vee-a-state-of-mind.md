First of all, I do not really know much about the artist asides from this one album and it has been a struggle to find more information about any other work. This album came out a few years ago, but has been apart of my rotation for so long. From this album, Vee is a dope producer, and A State of Mind starts of with the banger Tweet. The album features CL Smooth, Strange Fruit Project, Pase Rock, and Natural Habitz; with each artist getting a track to highlight both their skills and Vee&#8217;s skills. Even the instrumental tracks are really great.
