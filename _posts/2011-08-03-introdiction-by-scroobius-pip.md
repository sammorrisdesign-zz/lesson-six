I have to admit that a few years ago, one of my gateway albums back into hip-hop was Scroobius Pip vs dan le sac&#8217;s first album together. Not only did it sound completely different but the lyrics had weight and meaning to them &#8211; something that we&#8217;re kind of into around these parts. Anyway, after a quite frankly disappointing second album along side producer dan le sac, Scroobius has branched out on his own again. Listen to this track, and get back on board with Pip as he throws out gems such as &#8220;you see a mousetrap, I see free cheese and a fucking challenge&#8221;. The album, Distraction Pieces, is due out on the 20th of September.
