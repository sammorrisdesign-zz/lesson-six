Awon is fast becoming one of my favorite mc&#8217;s currently in the game with his ability to tell stories above many other mc&#8217;s. A few days ago, he dropped Love Supersedes II, which is a double cd with side A being produced by Thomas Prime and side B by Kameleon Beats. Side A is partially remixes of the first Love Supersedes over Thomas Primes jazzy production and some new tracks as well., while Side B continues on with the stories and the mood of the album. This is just another great piece of work by Awon, and the production by Thomas Prime and Kameleon Beats fits very well into the entire mood of the album.
