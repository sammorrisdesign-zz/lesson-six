Over here in Scotland the weather has been taking a bit of a turn with the days getting shorter and weathher getting bleaker. The dry days are getting few and far between as the rain is getting more frequent. Frost has begin to creep in and my electricity bills have been getting scarier than last nights Trick or Treaters. So I decided to throw something together about the change in weather. Tried being the key word. Some of the tracks fit the theme whereas others are added because they&#8217;re good and they mention something to so with the theme. Sorry. If it&#8217;s a little too wet and wild for you then go listen to our [Summer Â mixcloud](http://www.lessonsix.com/2010/08/a-lesson-six-mix-soundtrack-to-the-summer/) and cheer yourself up.

## CunningLynguists &#8211; Summer&#8217;s Gone

Great name, great band, and one of the only songs that fitted the theme perfectly.
  


## Ty &#8211; Rain

Us Brits know a little about rain, so who better to fill you in than _Ty_. Although the track is not really about the weather&#8230;
  


## Collective Efforts &#8211; Winterlude

There was a few tracks that I could have taken from this album but I picked this one as it&#8217;s really fitting. Another group that I need to dedicate more time to.
  


## AFTA-1 &#8211; Rain

I know I featured AFTA-1 recently but this album is too good not to talk about again. Beautifully bleak.
  


## Hieroglyphics &#8211; After Dark

The clocks went back the other day and that means it&#8217;s going to be dark and cold by half four. I hate it. But I love _Hieroglyphics_ and _Del_.
  


## Del Tha Funkee Homosapien &#8211; Sunny Meadowz

See, told you I love _Del_. This is a little something to target when the rain and snow is getting you down.
