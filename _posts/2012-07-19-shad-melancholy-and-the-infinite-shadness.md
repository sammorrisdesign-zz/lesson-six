Just saw this pop up on my feed, and well its Shad, so I was pretty excited. This is a pretty short EP containing a bunch of songs Shad sampled from his childhood. You can download it for <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?xc7lc604ur1c3v8" target="_blank">free</a>, or pay what you want on band camp.
