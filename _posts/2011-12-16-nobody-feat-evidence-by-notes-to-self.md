We&#8217;ve got another crazy track from Notes To Self&#8217;s upcoming album _Used to be Dark._ This time the Canadian Hip-Hop group team up with Dilated People, Evidence, to create this throwback track about being around in the golden age of rap. This is coupled with a equally well done video. Looking for the album soon&#8230;
