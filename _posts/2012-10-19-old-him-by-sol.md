Sol has/is on a 9 month journey around the world, stopping in various countries while soaking up different cultures. This track comes from his stay in India, where he recorded the track after production was done by the zillas back in the US. A great track, and I can&#8217;t wait to hear more from Sol&#8217;s trip.
