Another month goes past and more release dates have been announced and we&#8217;re back with another list of what you should be putting on your radar. Hopefully people are finding these lists useful, as it&#8217;s stupidly tough to get updated lists of these dates.

Again, like always, this isn&#8217;t a definitive list. The one thing you can predict with this genre is that something pleasantly surprising is always around the corner and no doubt it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve forgotten. So keep those ears peeled, or whatever ears do to be ready and waiting for good music.
