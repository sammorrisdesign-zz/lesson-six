Here&#8217;s a track from Viceverses&#8217; &#8220;Native Blood&#8221; album that I&#8217;m currently listening to. I&#8217;ll be honest, I hadn&#8217;t heard of them before we got an email and their work hasn&#8217;t been circulating around the blogs. It&#8217;s a shame really, because they clearly deserve more focus than they&#8217;re getting. Expect to see a review on the site soon.
