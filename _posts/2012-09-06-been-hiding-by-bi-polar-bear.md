Like all good Kickstarter campaigns, Bi-Polar Bear&#8217;s was quickly achieved. I&#8217;ve been listening to the advance that donors got their ears around for helping out and it&#8217;s one to wait for, ahead of it&#8217;s 18th of September release. In the meantime, watch the hijinks of a guy wearing the head polar bear costume.
