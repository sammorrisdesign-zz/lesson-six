The video for &#8220;Slumdog&#8221; by Moruf off his free album, Ready 2 Life, that you can [download now](http://ready2live.tumblr.com/). Really reminiscent of 10.4 Rog&#8217;s production for The Good Sin on [&#8220;Late&#8221;](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/02/the-good-sin-10-4-rogs-late/) a few months back although this is actually the late J Dilla. Anyway, if you ignore the few weed references this is a pretty solid track.
