&#8220;Outro&#8221; is the frantic rock-rap crossover from ex-J5 DJ, Cut Chemist. This collaboration, sees Blackbird rapping furiously over what sounds like a new direction for Cut Chemist with production rich in heavy guitars and rabid drums. It will be interesting to see if his new album, expected this year, has the same furious sound to it. Headbang.
