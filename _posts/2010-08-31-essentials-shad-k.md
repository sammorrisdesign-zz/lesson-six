Despite being only three albums deep, Shad K has made one hell of a name for himself in the underground scene. Rightly so, TSOL remains one of the highest rated albums on Lesson Six and if we we&#8217;re around when The Old Prince came out, I&#8217;m sure that would be up there as well. So without further ado, here is Shad&#8217;s Essentials.

## Shad &#8211; I Get Down

_From the album, When Is This Over_



If I get nothing else from compiling this list, I&#8217;ll will have gotten an urge to go back and listen to his first album. Naturally I&#8217;ve been listening to it a bit more in order to compile this list but it&#8217;s been criminally under-listened. Here&#8217;s one of the better tracks from the When Is This Over.

## Shad &#8211; Out of Love Part 2

_From the album, The Old Prince_



Even self-proclaimed conscience rappers wouldn&#8217;t get this reflective.

## Shad &#8211; Get Up

_From the album, The Old Prince_



I&#8217;m sure that most criticism of Shad is that he hardly has upbeat tracks. Well if he didn&#8217;t remedy that on The Old Prince, he definitely did on TSOL. Here&#8217;s a choice from the former.

## Shad &#8211; Yaa I Get It

_From the album, TSOL_



And here&#8217;s a choice form the latter.

## Shad &#8211; Rose Garden

_From the album, TSOL_



I&#8217;ll leave you with this, because if this doesn&#8217;t get you into his music then you&#8217;re probably on the wrong site. Great upbeat stuff here with an even better video.
