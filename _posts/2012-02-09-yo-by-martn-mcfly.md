This kind of aggressive sounding rap is few and far between. Mart!n McFly, otherwise known as Knamelis + SUP∆83, come with an incredibly raw and hard-hitting sound in &#8220;Yo!&#8221; and have to be applauded for not steering it into cliché territory. Knamelis&#8217; lyrics could have easily came out as brag rap and fallen into generic battle lyricism but he&#8217;s risen above that and the rewards are for all to see. &#8220;Yo!&#8221; comes off the duo&#8217;s [recently released](http://mxmcx.bandcamp.com/) self-titled album.
