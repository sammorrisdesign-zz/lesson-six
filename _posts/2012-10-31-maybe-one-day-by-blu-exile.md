While it&#8217;s taken about a year for us to hear the final version ofÂ _Give Me My Flowers While I Can Still Smell Them_, the wait for the fully mastered version was worth it. Exile&#8217;s production on here really elevated him as one of the best loop based producers around now. He really holds the whole LP together while lyrically Blu isn&#8217;t at his most interesting.
