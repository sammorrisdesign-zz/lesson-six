I&#8217;ll admit it, I was hoping to get the Best of 2010 mix out at the end of 2010 but it ended up coming out nearly two weeks into the new year. However, the other thing we were hoping to do was put out more of these things. Since our weekly Top Sixes are on hiatus (exciting developments to come soon though) this is one of the better ways to share older music with you, along with a some current stuff. So that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re putting out another January Mixcloud.

<!--more-->

Personally, and I know I&#8217;m not alone, I find it difficult to write and listen to music which often leaves me sitting in silence. So we wanted to provide something instrumental that was suitable to write along to. Hopefully the following thirty-six minutes will be exactly that.

  1. Thes One &#8211; Gate City Savings & Loan
  2. Full Crate & FS Green &#8211; To The Floor
  3. Blend Crafters &#8211; Bad Luck Blues
  4. Elaquent &#8211; Mystery
  5. People Under The Stairs &#8211; Sunroof
  6. Incise &#8211; A New Day
  7. Junk Science &#8211; Whatever&#8217;s Classico
  8. Above The Clouds &#8211; Television
  9. MF Doom &#8211; Fenugreek
 10. TLO &#8211; Telephone
 11. J. Howells Werthmann &#8211; Biking Home on the Tail End of Something Good

For those new to our mixes, we should probably point out that you can’t download it. At Lesson Six we try to support the artists as much as possible and thus put our mixes on [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/LessonSix/). Mixcloud allows you to legally stream our mixes while donating some of the revenue it makes back to the artists. We haven&#8217;t completed an iTunes mix for this one but if you use them, please let us know and we&#8217;ll keep making them. Apple don&#8217;t tell us if people use them and quite frankly going into buying a collection of tracks blind is asking for a lot of trust. Again we&#8217;ve created a [Spotify playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/lessonsix/playlist/6mZxwxfaBNqOkfZz50uUbY) (because you can import from iTunes easily) but, again, we&#8217;ve only selected a small percentage of Spotify-able tracks (three out of eleven).
