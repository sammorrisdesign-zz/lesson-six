The first leak/single off of Bop Alloy&#8217;s upcoming album The R&R. The song is super smooth, mellow and relaxed. The cover art also gives off that vibe. If you want to help fund the album release, go to the <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/The-R-and-R?a=130379&i=addr" target="_blank">campaign site</a>. Really looking forward to this album.
