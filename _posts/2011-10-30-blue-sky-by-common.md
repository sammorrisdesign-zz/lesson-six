Blue Sky, the latest track to come out from The Dreamer, The Believer got video treatment. This song is vintage Common and sounds real good. The video fits the song so well with the color scheme and the way each person is practicing their respective &#8220;art.&#8221; With the work I&#8217;ve heard so far I keep getting more hyped for this release.
