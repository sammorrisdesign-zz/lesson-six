Seeing as it was Jurassic 5&#8242;s essential week, and it&#8217;s Instrumental Thursday, I thought I&#8217;d post this little collaboration.

I&#8217;m a HUGE Incubus fan, especially their first two albums, and it was only recently that I realised that this track featured that talents of DJ Nu-Mark and Cut Chemist. It&#8217;s a funky track with some amazing scratching, and I love the sample &#8211; it&#8217;s clas-cla-cla-clas-class.

Their first album featured DJ Lyfe &#8211; who was replaced with Chris Kilmore, who did the video above &#8211; and he also had the opportunity to mess around with some interesting instrumental tracks. This one is a little weird but it too features some crazy samples. I think there was some hallucinogenics floating around the Incubus studio when this was recorded.
