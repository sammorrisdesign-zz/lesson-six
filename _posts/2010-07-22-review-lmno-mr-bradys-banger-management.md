Recording ten albums in a lifetime is a tough task for most artists. Recording ten in one year, forget about it. Then again this is the sixth _LMNO_ album, of a prospective ten, for 2010. The challenge that _The Visionaries_ alumni set himself was to record ten albums this year with ten different producers. The project&#8217;s an intriguing one that is sure to catch attention regardless of quality. Unfortunately, the fear of quantity over quality becomes a real one with _Banger Management_. Meaning that the most recent in the series ends up sounding like a slightly more polished mixtape rather than a full release.

Despite what you think a album called _Banger Management_ would sound like, the production is very unique. _Mr.Brady_, who frequently joins _LMNO_ on the mic as well, creates beepy, chip-tune inspired, bass-driven beats. It&#8217;s actually the perfect accompaniment to _LMNO&#8217;s_ voice and _Banger Management_ is unmistakeably underground. While it means that most of the album sounds similar, it at least gives it a distinct sound when compared to previous _LMNO_ releases.

> &#8220;This is for the children of the machine / Taking out your Turbographix 16 / All hunched over, rings under my eyes / PS3 got me all hypnotised&#8217;

Unfortunately it&#8217;s lyrically weak. Constant weed references combined with the occasional gunplay means _Banger Management_ is far from cliché free. That&#8217;s not to say that the album is full of throwaway tracks. The opening is pretty solid with the title track in particular, impressing. Both lyricists frantically pass the mic whilst delivering a standard self-hyping fare. Admittedly the beat spares some of the weaker lines for criticism on this one.

Elsewhere, &#8220;Original&#8221; sets the scene for the entire album, both in terms of production and lyrics. While &#8220;Arcade&#8221; is a weird amalgamation of video games and traditional hip-hop. Unlike songs like _People Under The Stairs_&#8216; &#8220;Gamin&#8217; On Ya&#8221;, this has more fury to it. Which means the resulting four minutes is awkward to say the least.

While I&#8217;m far from an expert, I&#8217;ve heard LMNO deliver quality [before](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvD24SROJE). That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s even more disappointing when he turns out like most Underground rappers, stuck between meaning and the clichéd. While it&#8217;s easier to excuse the embarrassing weed references, the occasional gunplay is enough to put a sour taste in your mouth. It&#8217;s harder to take because you&#8217;ve heard him at his best. Blind optimism, maybe, but let&#8217;s just hope that this is something he had to get out of the way. After all, he&#8217;s still got four more attempts to inject a little more meaning and a little less played-out.
