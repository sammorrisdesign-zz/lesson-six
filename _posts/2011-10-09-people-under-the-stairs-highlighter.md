People Under the Stairs (puts) has been arguably one of the most successful independent hip-hop acts of the past decade. This album is arguably their most ambitious album to date, as they enlisted help from producers and studios all over LA. From the opening track Selfish Destruction to the conclusion, I can not get over the production of the album. The production of Selfish Destruction especially caught my ear, and then you are thrown right into The Second Track, and there is no break from the catchy production. Thes One and Double K both stay strong and on point trading verses on the various tracks. This is probably one of the best albums of their storied career, and well you just have to listen to it yourself.
