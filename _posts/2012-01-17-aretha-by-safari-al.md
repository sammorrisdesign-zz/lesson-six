They&#8217;re a relatively young group of rappers.

That&#8217;s pretty much all the Whethermen have in common with strange internet sensation, OFWGKTA. So seeing as we&#8217;re not into rape that much, we&#8217;re siding with nerdy andÂ intellectual Whethermen. We&#8217;ve already raved about highly quotable rapper, [Milo](http://www.lessonsix.com/2011/12/introducing-milo/), but the other day we got sent through an email from Safari Al. The singer/rapper has just released his first mixtape, [Hermitage Academy](http://safarial.bandcamp.com/), and I&#8217;m not going to lie, it&#8217;s pretty damn good. Highly recommended, and these are definitely, ones to look out for in 2012.
