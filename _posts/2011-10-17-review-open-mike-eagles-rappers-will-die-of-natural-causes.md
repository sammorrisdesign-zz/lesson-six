Open Mike Eagle has always been on the verge of something. He&#8217;s clearly an intelligent guy, or at least the self-proclaimed art rapper came off as such in his first album, &#8216;Unapologetic Art Rap&#8217;. Tracks like &#8216;I Rock&#8217; proved that he had some smarts and showed that Mike was on the verge of something unique. The same is true of his sophomore release &#8216;Rappers Will Die of Natural Causes&#8217; where he comes to the realisation that he&#8217;s actually the &#8220;smartest broke guy ever&#8221; for choosing a life of art-hop.

However, in such a realisation a natural bitterness crops up frequently. Luckily he redirects that resentment towards mainstream hip-hop, how the first generation will wait in retirement homes & perceptions of black culture as a whole. The results, although humorous, are eloquently made and intelligent. Which is why it&#8217;s even tougher to take when Mike does throw up a few clich√© ridden topics.

Conflicting? Yes, maybe, I mean he does comment how rapping about guns is played out but then makes whole tracks about smoking weed, something that&#8217;s probably just as tiresome, if not more. It&#8217;s pretty infrequent but enough to damper the LP.

However, for a new artist a competent and intelligent sounding album on the second attempt is seldom seen and there is more than enough to warrant a listen. Even if it is only for a glimpse of that illusive brilliant album Open Mike Eagle has been threatening to deliver.
