I&#8217;ve always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with _Dilated Peoples_. About a year ago I went through a faze when they were all I listened to. I was obsessed, that was until I unpacked the lyrics and struggled to find much. After that it was just excellent production that read like a who&#8217;s who list of top-notch underground hip-hop producers from the early 00s. While I&#8217;m a sucker for an excellently found sample, it can only sustain for so long. So, with no surprise, it was with hesitation when I headed into _Rakaa Iriscience&#8217;s_ solo debut, _Crown of Thorns_.

<!--more-->You&#8217;ll quickly realise how big 

_Dilated Peoples_ were back in their day. Not only because _Rakaa_ makes countless references to trio from California, but also because _Rakaa_ has amassed quite a guestlist. Then again that guestlist can mainly be put down to &#8220;Ambassador Slang&#8221;. Names like _Dumbfoundead, Epic High, Tiger JK_ and more combine to create something that sounds like a fiercer Californian version of &#8220;The Militia&#8221;.

Elsewhere, _KRS-One_ nails the hook on the album&#8217;s highlight &#8220;Human Nature&#8221;. _Chali 2na_ collaborates to form something that should have been the _Jurassic 5 / Dilated Peoples_ crossover you&#8217;ve been waiting for. Unfortunately neither _Babu_ or _Cut Chemist_ is on the track and _Chali&#8217;s_ recent lost direction means &#8220;Mean Streak&#8221; feels slightly lacklustre. Then we have a bit of a _Dilated_ reunion with _Evidence_, honorary Dilated Person _Defari_, production from frequent collaborator _Alchemist_ and a ubiquitous appearance from _Fashawn_ &#8211; who seems to be everywhere at the moment. The track in question &#8220;Aces High&#8221; is naturally as close to that _Dilated_ sound, this album gets.

> Living in inferno, fire&#8217;s hard to keep contained / You brought lights into the world, out the ash the phoenix came / Love that came from war, change your language and your name / I know for a fact you have the strength to beat the pain.

While solo though, _Rakaa_ occasionally steps out of the weed-smoking party mode that was mastered with _Dilated Peoples_, he makes the well produced beats his own with topical references and strong battle raps. Tracks like &#8220;Connect The Dots&#8221; and &#8220;Delilah&#8221; are among some of the better rhymes on the album. Still, it&#8217;s on the album&#8217;s closer &#8220;Upstairs&#8221; where you really start to hear the beginnings of something special. _Rakaa_ talks about an accident happening to a close friend and how he dealt with it. It feels completely out of place but after fifty-five minutes of quite frankly average and boilerplate lyricism, you don&#8217;t mind it one bit. Maybe it was an experiment, maybe it was the only event he felt comfortable talking about or maybe it was just a slow album closer. Whatever it was, it shows great potential that would be criminal to ignore next time around.

For now though, _Rakaa&#8217;s_ solo debut delivers 12 tracks of competent party and battle rap along with one track brimming with future potential. Dilated junkies won&#8217;t be disappointed by this offering as it still has that distinct sound for a majority of the album. If enjoyed _Dilated Peoples_ then don&#8217;t hesitate to pick it up, just don&#8217;t be surprised when it&#8217;s nothing exceptionally innovative.
