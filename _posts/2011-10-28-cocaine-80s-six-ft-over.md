Common and No I.D team up on this track released on Cocaine 80s Ghost Lady EP. This is the vintage Common sound that most people will recognize. With anticipation building up for Common&#8217;s next album, the work I&#8217;ve heard from the album plus other releases make The Dreamer, The Believer one of the most anticipated albums in a while.
