Theory Hazit has been busy working on the third installment of the Lord Fire series. Each installment was produced entirely by someone else with the first one being produced by Vintage. The third installment is titled Thr3e, and is produced by Dert. Theory Hazit, has worked with many artists like Scribbling Idiots and has successfully embarked on a solo career. With Theory being a part of Humblebeast records, some listeners may shy away since they do focus on religion and in some ways it can be considered religious rap. Either way, Theory Hazit puts out some great music and to promote Thr3e, Theory Hazit and Humblebeast have been releasing videos.

Here are the videos and I will update this post as more promotional videos come out.
